    "No",
    "Not sure what you\u2019re talking about man. There are tons of new bands making great music right now. You just have to know where to find them. It\u2019s not older bands fault that new bands aren\u2019t more popular. Commercial radio stations don\u2019t play new, up and coming bands and MTV doesn\u2019t play music videos anymore. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t good music out there. It\u2019s just not being promoted by big labels and radio stations like back in the day. This isn\u2019t Kiss\u2019 fault. It\u2019s Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group, and Warner Music Group\u2019s fault. These companies decide what gets popular. And they play it safe. These big companies are risk averse.

I am quite a bit older than you, I have seen music change, Rock as well as what they used to call Country. \nSo tell Stevie Wonder to Stop, Santana, and you mentioned U2, so who else? Coldplay? \nThe music I listened to, my Generation, was the Beetles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Eagles,Led Zeppelin, Linda Ronstadt,Tom Petty,Queen, The Who, Eric Clapton, James Taylor,Talking Heads,Steely Dan, Lou Reed,ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jim Croce, Nazareth,Al Green,Heart,and many more. It was in my opinion the best music, bands and singers in all time. Not only could we listen to these bands we could see them in concert and we didn\u2019t have to sell a kidney to do it. Yeah, it may have been festival seating but who cared. There may have been some passing around of smoking material, from people that we didn\u2019t know, but everyone was chill, it was a different time, if I could go back and see those bands again I might, I did see Elvis Costello in the early 2000\u2019s it was great, but you can\u2019t capture that magic again. But to say they are getting Grammy\u2019s and not allowing new talent? Maybe politics could enter into it. I\u2019ve seen what has gone on the few times I\u2019ve watched. \u201csour grapes\u201d this person has had this many Grammys but can\u2019t get best album.

    "That partial is a reason. But what if, let's say U2 quit in 2000? Record labels would have needed to adapt and promote new bands to radiostations. But they didn't and I believe that didn't trigger their label to sign new talent. The same with festivals. They complain that there aren't any new rock bands and bands are aging. Rock bands are still a major pull for people to buy tickets.\u00a0\nUntil the 90s festivals helped making new bands. After that they kept signing the same old bands because festivals were on a high and people had money to burn. So why risk anything. But that kept younger bands back.\nAnd sure times changed. Streaming, radio everything is readily available to find new music. But I'd like to see this young bands make it as big as well.\u00a0",

But I still think that every decennium deserves their own musical heroes without old acts \"being in their way\". Let Fleetwood Mac be a band from the 70s and 80s. Like The Stones should have stayed a band from the 60s and 70s and U2 from the 80s and 90s. The 2010s and 20s need their own big names.",
    "Really? The Stones and The Beatles won Grammy's this year!?\u00a0\nYou play whatever you like. And artists should make new music until they die. I don't mind at all and I love music from the 60s onward.\u00a0",

    "Young rock bands aren\u2019t gonna get big the way they used to in the 60s through the 90s unless there is some sort of cultural shift. TikTok decides what is popular now and currently that means vapid pop music. And if you go by what these corporations dictate as popular, you will be very disappointed. However, take a band like King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. They have a huge following with fans around the world. They\u2019ve put out 26 studio albums since 2012, tour constantly with each concert selling out and they don\u2019t show any signs of slowing down any time soon. But you won\u2019t hear them on mainstream radio or in Super Bowl commercials. They are still considered an indie band. If they would have come out in the 70s they would probably be as big as Led Zeppelin or Rush.\n\nThe culture needs to change. I don\u2019t know what it would take for that to happen but I often think about when Nevermind came out in 1991. At the time rock was dominated by glam and hair bands and the number one artist was Michael Jackson. Nevermind ended up unseating Michael Jackson from the number 1 spot and grunge became mainstream overnight. Preppy kids and jocks started wearing flannel shirts and Converse and every record label was looking for the next Nirvana. The music in the 90s was pretty great as a result. We\u2019ve had a lot of great bands since Nirvana but the culture has slipped back in to pushing pop music like it was in the 80s. So the culture needs to change if we want to see a resurgence in rock music.",

It was overplayed to shit when it was released, but it\u2019s not a bad song. The Rolling Stones also continued to have good output in the 80\u2019s. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that the situation with the Grammys isn\u2019t fucked up, but your blame is misplaced. The problem isn\u2019t with the artists it\u2019s with the record industry as a whole.",

    "\n\nLet's be clear, music is subjective, and it can be hard to argue on both sides on whether she deserved to win or not. But we can look at it objectively to determine if it was reasonable by analyzing her charting and # streams then compare them to another top perfroming country artist this past year. Since she also won top album of the year let's compare her to other top artists as well. \n\nFirst let's look at billboard ratings, which counts how many times a week an album or single is played and charts them on the top 100 or 200 weekly. And by quote \"Chart positions are based on multi-metric consumption, blending traditional album sales, track equivalent albums, and streaming equivalent albums.\" \n\nSo how often did beyonce chart for top country album? 4 times, 3 in April and once in May. How about charts for top album of 2024? 2 times, 2 in April. \n\n To compare the most listened country album of 2024 was Morgan Wallen with \"one thing at a time\" charting most frequently with a total of 34 times between December 2023 and January 2025. \n\nTo also compare for top album of 2024 is taylor swift with \"tortured poets department\" top charting 17 times. \n\nSo she clearly didn't win by frequency of top charting in either catagory. \n\nWhat about total number of media consumption like streams? Let's look at spotify for this, She got About 1.6 billion streams in total for \"cow boy carter\".\n\nHow does she compare to Morgan Wallen? His album \"one thing at a time\" amassed 6.5 billion streams on spotify.\n\nHow about biliie eilish? \"Hit me hard and soft\" amassed 5.6 billion streams on spotify. \n\nAnd taylor swift? \"5 billion streams on spotify\n\nTherefore she doesn't even beat out anyone here by streams either. However, she did in technicality, place 2nd for top charting country album outperforming other artists within the charts and # streams.\n\nNow with all that being said, Morgan Wallen was not considered for a grammy this year because his album simply did not release within the required time period. Therefore Beyonce would've won the grammy for best country album this year anyways considering she outperformed other country artists.\n\nAs for top album of the year? What the hell was this outcome, definitely not deserved when looking at it objectively, and if this isn't proof of Grammys being fixed or biased, idk what is. Let's be clear, I did not like taylor swifts album because I'm not her target audience. but if I'm looking at it objectively, she could've won it. \n\nAnd Let's not forget billie eilish, She definely had a better shot at winning top album of the year opposed from beyonce based off streaming statistics. \n\nIn conclusion, I think she would've won top country album regardless of what anyone says solely basing on streams and charts (unless I'm proven otherwise by someone else). But top album? Come on people, get real, what do the grammys prove then? If the voting is entirely subjective then why do people watch it? \n\nNow to express myself and be subjective for the sake of it, In my honest opinion, I just didn't enjoy her album as much as I expected or quite frankly at all. I didn't find much of the songs catchy and felt like they missed the emotional mark much of beyonces previous top hit songs hold. And to be even more blunt, her album felt more like an attempt to \"represent\" black people in country music in order to \"break\" the system or something along those lines. Honestly, country isn't her style of genre, I applaud the attempt, but I feel like it might have performed better if it felt more like she was interested in the genre, than challenging it and inserting herself in it for the sake of racial demographics. To go deeper, articles about the album glaze over the fact that she's a \"woman of color attempting to break into country music\". In my opinion who gives a shit, that shouldn't be a selling point for anything. Black people and quite frankly any other race can thrive in any genre without having to glaze over their \"identity\" and \"demographics\". In my opinion, to even factor race and sex in an non-athletic form of competition is just disgusting and literally the definition of sexism and racism. \n\nTo compare to her best work \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\",  which IMO is a fantastic album rooted with emotion and excellent writing, with songs written about relationships from a female perspective, ultimately proves her ability to legitimately win a grammy and produce fantastic songs. The only song I could sit and listen to without immidiately changing the song from \"Cowboy Carter\" was \"Levi's jeans\" which, I personally didn't find amusing enough to intentionally put it on repeat or on my playlists.\n\nAnd before anyone starts commenting, yes I listened to the entirety of the album, and yes I do occasionally listen to country music. I just didn't like it that much for the aforementioned reasons. I am not a racist and much of the music I listen to comes from African American people. But i don't listen to their music just because they are black, I listen to it because it's enjoyable. I feel alot of people might have a bias to glazing her album because she is a \"woman and black\" which yenno what, that's fine, all the power to ya. But for an award to be bestowed with no statistics to justify it? That's wild to me. \n\n And if we factor all of what i said in it just seems like she got the top album of the year grammy for just being of a woman of color attempting another swing at country opossed from statistical performance. Which is just wrong, Beyonce does have the following and skills to outperform her competitors, but she did not stick to her roots which in my opinion, resulted in her win for top album being controversial and a bit insulting. In my opinion billie eilish or taylor swift deserved the win.\n\nI hope I don't get blasted for speaking my mind, all here for discussion :)",

    "Listen, I love Beyonce (though I've not been a fan of her recent work but I know she's talented and forever one of the greats) but all I ever saw online about Cowboy Carter was that people weren't a fan. Did I feel like it was unfair criticism at times? Yes. But Cowboy Carter and it's singles weren't widespread favorites and they weren't everywhere either. It was easier not to have heard any of the songs if you weren't listening to the radio. On the other hand, I would say that Billie Eilish's songs were everywhere, on the radio, in stores, used in a movie commercial, etc and for a long time after the album was released. It was also a widespread favorite, even among people who weren't Billie fans. \n\nI think Beyonce should've won AOFY at least once in her career but not for this album. The Grammys trying to backpedal and give her this award because they feel regretful over not awarding it to her in the past, is just unfair to the artists who were in the category this year. Create a category for the outliers who didn't get awards when they shouldve, for iconic, culturally significant albums for cases like this so that Beyonce's previous snubs can be corrected but this ain't it. I was honestly surprised by this result and I'm surprised there isn't more push back about it.\n\nNow the country album, idk about that one. Idk if it played differently in the country scene but I kind of doubt it. But I can give that a pass, versus AOTY because to me, AOTY surpasses any genre constraints and I don't think she did that. I actually thought this was probably her most under performing album and I felt support for her was falling off.",

    "I'm not a fan of Beyonce. I think she always seems to be the \"center of attention\" and doesn't know how to blend in. I think her trauma with the paparazzi and the public seems to close her off to her fans, and maybe that's necessary. She has some great songs, but even II Most Wanted sounds wrong for me because Beyonce doesn't balance out Miley. However, I can never seem to escape her music nor her vocals. She's a fantastic singer and has written and performed some amazing, some catchy, and some emotional songs. Beyonce is not Beyonce without her voice.\n\nWith that being said, this was not the album that deserved to win, but I believe the album that was necessary to win. This album for Beyonce feels like she let AI do her homework based on what criteria she wanted and her previous work. Her songs are catchy, and that's cool and all, but when you've been listening to someone for literal decades, you can sense a familiarity in their music. This music doesn't feel like Beyonce. Her last 4 albums sounded like her; different sound, still her. This is \"someone took Beyonces actual country album, tried to replicate it, failed, filled in the missing gaps and then said 'I promise this is Beyonces album\" This award feels like a pity award for neglecting her previous work, and because they got called out. It makes it even more obvious that attention needs to be brought to their nomination and awarding processes. \n\nAccording to Statista, women aren't even nominated for the album of the year as much as men are. \"Between the years of 2013 and 2024, 14.7 percent of artists nominated for Grammy awards were female, and 85.3 percent were male.\" This has been in the media since 2016, but this is the first year they are addressing it.\n\nIf we want to truly be able to criticize the fairness of whether someone \"deserves\" an award, then the Grammys need to be more transparent about their criteria for nomination and awards. Otherwise, we keep falling into this trap of \"did they actually deserve to win.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/801372/gender-grammy-nominees/#:~:text=Gender%20distribution%20of%20Grammy%20nominees%20in%20the%20U.S.%202013%2D2024&text=Between%20the%20years%20of%202013,gender%20distribution%20in%20the%20industry.",

To me it just felt stereotypical, like most country music I've listened to doesn't just throw every single thing country related into a song. To me it isn't about color, and I think she's an amazing artist. And I'm still young so I don't know completely about the grammys, I just wanted to voice my opinion.",

    "> I think it is so telling that people are being absolutely terrible to Beyonc\u00e9 after the Grammys.\n\nGood opening line. \n> She is genuinely the biggest artist of this generation\n\nAre you sure? Most would disagree. Look at Spotify stream numbers.\n> and people saying that this was rigged are not realizing how hard Beyonc\u00e9 has worked and that these wins were well deserved.\n\nBeyonce has worked hard her whole career. How was her award at the Grammys different. Did she work even harder this time? Show, don't tell.\n> I\u2019m not saying that the Grammys haven\u2019t been unfair before, but I think people are being too critical of Beyonc\u00e9 specifically. People have been so quick to bash Cowboy Carter without even listening to it. People are mad that she won for best country album and are making fun of her, but nobody understands the history behind her album and her true motivation. \n\nAgain, show, don't tell. What was the history behind the album? What was her true motivation. If you make claims support them!\n> She reclaimed a genre that has been taken over by white people despite its origins.\n\nThis objectively not true. Country music was derived from many musical traditions including English, Scots, and Irish origins. African American influence only came about post Civil War times. The genre only gained popularity with the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, both of which were of traditionally \"white\" origins (Jimmie Rodger's family was from Ireland.)\n> This was well deserved and shows her impact on country music.\n\nExplain her impact on country music. How did Beyonce change the genre with this album?\n>People are also not understanding how big of a deal it is that she won album of the year. She\u2019s been working for over 20 years and she has more than 30 grammys and not one of them is an album of the year.\n\nAlbum of the year is not determined by how long an artist has been performing, but by how popular their music is amongst her fan and in the genre itself.\n> Billie is only 23 and has so many Grammys, I can guarantee that she will have another shot at album of the year in the near future. (mind you she already has won all of the year) \n\nThis is a good point and goes more to show how popular Billie Eilish is compared to Beyonce. \n> I honestly think people are so quick to dismiss Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s career and achievements just because she\u2019s a woman of color. \n\nI give this paper an F\n\n1. Didn't properly discuss the topic\n2. Didn't properly justify the win\n3. Didn't compare or contrast Beyonce against the other artists she won against\n4. Didn't explain how Beyonce impacted country music; Show, don't tell.\n5. Doesn't properly attribute the AOTY. Album of the year isn't earned because one has experience. It's earned because people liked it.\n6. Improper association between Beyonce's age and her popularity. Age of the artist doesn't guarantee popularity.\n7. Didn't stay on topic. Brings race and politics into a discussion about music.\n\nIn short, Beyonce didn't deserve Album of The Year because she's black. She deserved it because people liked it... which I'm not seeing evidence that they did. This was an undeserved win. This is why people are being terrible to her. She stole someone else's AOTY.\n\nEdit: Also before anyone tries to bring race into my comment, I'm American Indian. Which begs the questions, when are more AI artists going to gain national recognition and popularity and start winning Grammys?",
    "Because Its 100% based whatever reason of the judges opinion of artists who are on popular labels for whatever reason the judges choose.\n\nIf you every heard someone say \"Music business\" its exactly like a business. Their product is the artist, just like Apple sells iMac.",
    "The only reason she flipped over to country music is cuz she failed in every other genre of music. Even the country singers that have been in the country music industry for decades do not consider her a country singer. Her husband bought her Grammy and all the whining and bitching and complaining that she didn't win all the other times yeah she didn't win.",
    "Bro how stupid do u have to be to not even account for the fact jay z paid radio stations 150 million dollars to pump that album up that high? It wasn\u2019t her music, it was her financial situation. That isn\u2019t what we care about and it never has been. The Grammys have been a shit show for years and tons of people see it, the only ones who think she\u2019s relevant haven\u2019t stepped out from under a rock in 15 years. She\u2019s made nothing of value since she was on that Austin powers movie and that\u2019s facts. She was scouted by jay z at a diddy party, that\u2019s where they met, she was also underage. Not opinion, fact. They\u2019re terrible people using money to control the entire system they\u2019ve laid out in front of us, and it\u2019s happening on almost every front possible at this point. Bro do u actually expect people to believe some of the amazing country music that came out this year is just somehow irrelevant because jay z can push her into any lane and pay her way to streams, radio play, and media presence? Yeah that\u2019s not music",
    "Your opinion immediately lost any and all value the moment you chalked up the criticism to \u201cyou only don\u2019t like it cause she\u2019s black!\u201d Instead of the fact that it had a single popular song and disappeared a month after it dropped, and suddenly appeared again at the Grammys",
    "Here's the reason why I think it's good. Just because an album has good intentions like Beyonce's does not actually make it a good album. I, unlike most, have listened to it. It is trash. It is unlistenable. 2/10 album. I do not want to listen to it ever again. When I listened to it, I was actually going in thinking it would be good, since that is what I heard at the time. I was mistaken. I think it is simultaneously this and the fact that this year was such a HUGE year for music with so many amazing albums and releases that explains why people are so upset. To be honest, I think literally every other artists who was nominated deserves the grammy more than her. Also, to put it lightly, Beyonc\u00e9 is overrated in general. She is a great artist, don't get me wrong, but she has the most grammies. She absolutely does not deserve that title. Also, \"Queen of pop\" is kinda crazy considering there are MANY other pop artists who are better than her. I think people are just fed up with Beyonc\u00e9 being dick-rode to no end and how she is held as some Golden standard when she hasn't made good music in years. Respectfully. I know her cultural impact has been huge and great, but the music is all that should matter in the grammies, and her music is FINE.",
    "What's amazing how people who listen to the likes of Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, George Strait, Reba, Dolly, Alan Jackson, the late Tim McGraw, Brooks & Dunn, the late Charley Pride, Rascally Flatts, Lady Antebellum, Barbara Mandrell, have NEVER heard Beyonce's air play on the likes of Dallas' 99.5 The Wolf... I guess she'll be voted as an outstanding pious woman and influencer in Christian circles next...",
    "I loved the reasoning and logic behind this argument all the way until the end. Loved how you reasoned that Beyonce's album was 2nd top charting country album, which is why she probably did deserve to win that one but I can see argument being made for why she didn't deserve it so also all is fair. But your last few paragraphs that's where you lost me. Maybe you're right maybe  people love Beyonce for being black and a women but can't the same argument then be made for Taylor Swifts grammy wins except exchange black for white. That her being a white women is why she does so well with an award ceremony that hadn't awarded a black women album of the year in the last 27 years until this past Sunday. Maybe we can do that with Adele too seeing how the common listeners thought when Adele won and even Adele to my understanding of that night, everyone thought that was the actual year Beyonce deserved AOTY and not her. \n\nI think she unrightfully got it after complaining for years about how she was snubbed and to be fair in my opinion, some of those years she was. With her husband last year complaining at the previous grammys about how beyonce never won aoty even though she then and still now has the most grammys awards of any artist or group of all time played a factor and made it look a certain way. Do I think Billie Ellish should have won yes, do I think Beyonce won because she's black hell no because if that was the case she would have won album of the year already. And to just hit home the fact that it's not because she was a black woman performing country to break into it or represent for black people...there have been plenty of times in recent history where country music  (CMA's) doesn't award or recognize black artist even when they have number 1 charting hits arguably the biggest country songs over their respective years, being Shaboozey and Lil Nas X. Shaboozey also didn't win any grammys so again I think if we're talking race that argument falls flat. Even with the intersectionality aspect I'm just not convinced. Not including that fact that only 3 black people have ever won period at the CMA's being black and doing country music is clearly not an advantage to anyone, including Beyonce.",
    "Agreed with every one of your points!!! Well said",
    "You reasoning is based off criteria that Grammy doesn\u2019t use. If that was the case, she would have beat Beck in 2015. It\u2019s based off artistic excellence and they mention that over and over that night. She may not of had the highest streams but her album was rated higher than Billie and Taylor\u2019s on every outlet from Metacritic\n to billboard. Billie lost every category, she was never going to win AOTY. She lost to Charli, Sabrina, and Kendrick, 6 noms by 4 people before the last category was even called. Artistically Cowboy Carter was a bit more loaded than hmhas was. In rare cases they choose talent over popularity. Like Beck over Beyonce and Beyonce over Billie.",
    "SO, Beyonc\u00e9's new album, just like her last one, has her dipping her toes into a genre that's not really her usual thing. The previous was dance music.\u00a0 And, yeah, the album's great and dominated the charts. But, honestly, I'm starting to think it's less about her genuinely wanting to explore these new sounds and more about just... knowing she can conquer anything she tries.\u00a0\u00a0\nLike, she's got such a massive fanbase that she's basically guaranteed to win, no matter what genre she tackles.\nIt almost feels like she's going into these genres just to prove a point",
    "This was a fascinating comment! Thanks for breaking down the metrics.",
    "First of all, your claim that Beyonce only got the top album of the year simply because she's black is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. She won because it's actually a pretty damn good album, and it's completely different from anything she's ever done before. That's why it hit the top of the country charts, even if the country gatekeepers refused to recognize the fact that she was even on the charts.\n\nWhat you don't understand, and refused to even acknowledge, is how country music has deliberately kept black artists shut out of the genre for decades---that's just flat-out racism right there. It's only been in the last decade that black artists have started to make any real headway in country music----such as Mickey Guyton, Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, The War & Treaty, Miko Marks, Alice Russell, Brittany Spencer, Breland, and others. Both Guyton and Rucker have been open in the last few years how difficult it was for them to even get into the country genre, and the racism they're had to deal with along the way, just for being black artists in that genre.\n\nThis claim that Beyonce should \"stick to her roots\" is a bunch of nonsense, too. She switched up genres because she got tired just sticking to her roots, and singing the same kind of music she's been singing for years. That's what most artists do----they like switching things up from time to time, to keep themselves sounding fresh. I've noticed that white artists get to do this all the time--hop from genre to genre, but black artists are only supposed to stick to singing R&B, gospel, jazz, and hip-hop, as if that's all they can sing or perform. It's an insult to black people to think that's all we're supposed to sing, and it's a bunch of BS.\n\nBeyonce literally grew up Texas, where so many country singers come from---that it's not even weird that she should actually be into it. The country music genre has been too lily-white, and too conservative, racist and stuck-in-the-mud for damn near a century know---and that's way too damn long. The country gatekeepers still act like it's the 1950s or something. White people do not have a claim on country music---that is, they are not the only ones who can play it, sing it, or write it, or even like it. Yet the white country gatekeepers still act like nobody who isn't white can't claim country music as their own. Screw that outdated, outmoded BS.\n\nThe fact that Beyonce hit the top of the country charts is proof that even white people don't mind listening to country music that isn't sung by a white person for a change, and that even they're tired of the same old same old whatever in country music. . That's being said, I'm glad she won, because she deserved to win. She didn't take a damn thing from Billie Ellish or Taylor Swift, who are allowed to sing whatever the hell they want, like most white artists do. Funny how no one mentions the Swift started out as a country artist herself, and how many white pop singers have had hits on the country charts over decades. Yet a black artist like Beyonce tries to do the same thing, and some white folks who like country act like the sky caved in, just because she did. It's so damn ridiculous. If she was white, we wouldn't even be discussing this.",

    "Seriously? I find it interesting how it's okay for Post Malone, who's not even a country music singer, to go ahead and just put out a country album, and it's no big deal----or for Jelly Roll, who was formerly a rapper, to just switch over to country music. The point being, when white pop artists switched over to country music, no one makes a big deal about it----yet according to you trolls, Beyonce shouldn't have been able to do the exact same thing. Apparently it's only a problem when she does it---yeah, okay. The majority of Cowboy Carter is 99% country---which you would know had you actually listened to it.",
    "Um, she spent five years making this album, she didn't just throw it out there, and the fact that it hit number one on the country charts means that she did earn it. She didn't go to the country station to promote because, to be frank, there was such a hateful backlash about her even having played at the CMAs in 2016, even thought she was invited to play there by the Dixie Chicks (they just call themselves the Chicks now) to do a song with them. She got a lot of hate simply for showing up there, which was so damn ridiculous, and hell yes, it was all about her being black. You just refuse to admit that racism has anything to with why there was such hate thrown at her from the CMA audience.  Explain to me exactly what Post Malone and Jelly Roll did to earn being country singers, even though neither one did anything like country before last year. What exactly is your definition of what one must do to be considered country, anyway? \n\nOh, and Beyonce didn't have to use her clout to get anything. The point being, I've never heard of a artist who was nominated 32 times, but never won anything. I can't even think of a single white artist that's happened to. She earned it, just like most artists who get Grammy noms or wins have. Clout alone does not get you a Grammy. As usual, none of you trolls know what you're talking about on this subject.",
    "are you white",
    "Absolutely,",
    "Lainey Wilson is actually a pretty good singer, but let's be real-----most of these country singers--who are mostly white, of course---start to all sound alike after awhile, and look alike. There's really nothing original or new about the way most of them currently sing. It's like they all have to stick to what an image of a country singer is, and never go beyond that. Which is why country has become so conservative and boring. Which is also why these new black country artists coming up are putting some fresh blood into it, even if the country gatekeepers themselves won't admit that. Country needs to change just like any other musical genre, or grow stale as hell----it can't just keep being stuck in the past forever. That goes for any other musical genre, but country just seems more stuck in a rut, and not wanting to move forward---as if its gatekeepers want to stay stuck in the '50s or something.\n\nAnd it's been nice to see more black country singers coming up, because their mere presence is challenging this old racist idea that country can only be an-all white space, which it's been for way too many decades, and why the hell that is still even the case. That old racist idea that country music is only for white people, when both black and white people started out playing and singing country music together in the mid-1800s, only started in the 1920s, when white guys in the music biz trying to market certain types of music decided that country music--i.e. white people singing and playing guitars--would only be marketed to white folks, while black folks playing guitars would be marketed to them separate as \"the blues\". And it's been that ever since. This is the 21st century----this old, tired-ass racist, completely out of date idea that country is only for white people needs to stop, and be buried somewhere.",

I own Cowboy Carter among some of her other work. And I understand and comprehend that just because she made an album outside her normal genre, it DOES NOT MEAN she deserves these accolades. The album simply wasn\u2019t as good as the others. Period!!!! Morgen Wallen got his first Grammy nomination with Post Malone this year. His first. Such a joke. Do you know who Morgan Wallen is? Have you listened to his music?? It crushes most of the country albums out there,,,,,,and yet the Grammys never nominated him. Till this year with Post. Why is that? It\u2019s odd to me. It\u2019s odd to me that Cowboy Carter beat out a huge country artist that has arguably one of the most unique voices:Chris Stapleton. We could call this racist. Cuz I\u2019m telling you, and you should hear this: It isn\u2019t only white people who are racist. The way it sounds,,,,,is that YOU are the one who determines who should receive accolades based on color. Not achievements. \n\nEveryone who is country knows that the CMT\u2019s are the serious country awards. They arent having it, hun. Maybe part of it is Beyonces boo-hoo attitude of, \u201cThey don\u2019t like me, they must be racist.\u201d Her husband whining and crying last year. Give me a break. She  just EXPECTED to win. Because she\u2019s entitled. She didn\u2019t get recognition at the CMT\u2019s\u2026\u2026so she and her fans scream \u201cracism\u201d. I\u2019m so sick of it. That whole dialog of racism every five minutes by someone. Stop. Everything isn\u2019t about race. But,,,,to you, it seems to be. \n\n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry, hun. But the majority of the population feels this way. You can\u2019t call everyone a racist. It\u2019s just,,,,wrong. She won because she and her husband have power. Everyone knows it. History will remember it that way. Mark my words. I\u2019m sure she can live with that fact. She seems to have no shame at this point. Can\u2019t even PRETEND to be surprised when they announced her as the winner. \n\nCome on!!!!!\ud83e\udd23",

    "Here's some good recent books about black folks' contributions to country music:\n\nMy Black Country: A Journey Through Country Music's Black Past, Present and Future, by Alice Randall---the author writes about her love of country music, and what it was like being one of the few black country songwriters in Nashville in the early '80s, and the racism she had to deal with at the time.\n\nBlack Country Music: Listening For Revolutions by Francesca T. Royster---this book is about the author's love of country music as a queer black woman, and what it's like being a black country music fan.\n\nDeFord Bailey: A Black Star In Early Country Music, By David C. Morton---this is the first book I've ever heard of written about Bailey, the first black country musician to play at the very first Grand Ole Opry, and who is credited with introducing the harmonica to the genre.\n\nCountry Soul: Making Music and Making Race In The American South, by Charles L. Hughes. This book goes into detail about how black country musicians' influence on their white contemporaries rarely translated into them getting any support for making their own country albums, or even trying to make a career out of it because of the racism in the country music biz.\n\n\n\nHidden In The Mix: The African-American Presence In Country Music, edited by Diane Pecknold. This is an interesting anthology of essays about black folks in the country music genre.\n\n\n\nThere was also another book called From Where I Stand: The Black Experience In Country Music, but it appears to be out of print. There was also a 3-CD box set with that same title that came out back in 1998, featuring the work of black country artists I'd never heard of at the time---I'm guessing the book was a companion to it. That same CD box set has been updated as of last year with a fourth CD, featuring a new collection of black country artists that have arrived since 2000. Here's an article about that:\n\n[Country Music Hall of Fame Spotlights Black Country Artists With Expanded Version of \"From Where I Stand\"](https://www.billboard.com/music/country/from-where-i-stand-set-expanded-set-country-music-hall-of-fame-1235697619/)",

    "First of all, I write a lot about subjects and things I like, just like anyone else on these boards. I'm not and have never been a part of the \"Beyhive\". I'm simply someone who liked Destiny's Child when they first came out, and thought all three of the ladies in the group could sing, and followed what each of them have done songwise since. Second of all, you're just mad that she won, and that your favorite artists didn't. Come on now----Beyonce winning is not taking a damn thing away from either Ellish or Morgan---everybody already knows who they are, and they're famous, too. So get over whining about them. The fact is, black artists have always been shut out of and ignored by the country music business, until recently, no matter how talented they were. That's just pure racism, pure and damn simple. Why else was Charley Pride the only black country artist they let slip in for decades? It darn sure as hell wasn't because they weren't any other equally talented black artists who wanted to sing country music. Also, how many white artists as talented as Beyonce do you know who have been nominated 32 times at the Grammys and still never actually won one? Can't think of one, can you? I thought not.\n\nThe thing is, white artists have always been allowed to jump into any genre they want, and still sell CDs, and win awards and prizes for them. Black artists are still expected to only sing gospel, R&B, or rap simply because they're black, told to stay in their lane, and not allowed to jump from genre to genre and experiment/mix things up---which is really ridiculous, in this day and age. Which is what Beyonce did, and some white folks who still have this outdated as hell racist idea that country music is only for white people to play and sing, are just so damn mad that she didn't go through the usual country music gatekeepers and just went straight to the top of the country charts without their permission.\n\nKeep in mind, Beyonce did go perform at the CMT's in 2016, to which she was invited, and she got such a nasty backlash from the audience there, that of course she never went back. The CMT even performed the gutless move of cutting her performance out of that special, which was even more pathetic. Basically a lot of white people just flat-out hated the fact that a black artist period was trying to sing country music at the CMT. It didn't matter that she came from the same state as a lot of country singers, and grew up listening to it and liking it, their attitude was that she had no business being there because she was black. I guarantee you if Taylor Swift (who started out as a country singer) had done the same exact thing as Beyonce, nobody would have a single damn problem with it, and you know that.\n\nYour opinion is just that--your opinion,period---you do not represent the \"majority of the population\" and it's really arrogant and laughable of you to think that you do. Once again, the fact that she went to the top of the country charts proves that she finally earned that Grammy. She's an artist who has always pushed and challenged herself to put out the best releases, when she could have just sat back, took it easy, and coasted on her back catalog.\n\nEven after over 25 years of being in the music biz, her music still sounds fresh, which isn't always the case with pop or R&B artists who have been around as long, or longer than she has. That's why I continue to listen to her music, because I appreciate artists who continue to push themselves musically. Your ridiculous claims that she only won because of her clout are so damn ridiculous. If she could use her clout to win, then how come it took her so long to get a Grammy? Your reasoning about that dosen't even make any damn sense when you really think about it. You're in complete denial about how racist the country music biz is and has always been. That why I posted those articles about country singers Mickey Guyton and Darius Rucker discussing how they're always had to deal with racism throughout their careers as black artists in the predominately white country music industry. Obviously you didn't even bother to read them. It's easy for white people to be denial about racism because they never have to deal with it at all, or just pretend that it dosen't exist, because it never affect them at all.\n\nAnd you keep claiming that Beyonce didn't \"earn\" her Grammy or the right to even be on the country charts---well, explain to me how Post Malone, a pop singer, and Jelly Roll, a former rapper \"earned\" the right to be on the country charts when neither one of them, like Beyonce, were even a part of the country music scene? Funny how nobody has a problem with either one of them switching to country music, even though they're not even traditionally \"country\". I find it interesting that when I asked that question in a previous post, you ignored it completely, and never bothered to even answer that question. Because you know good and damn well it's because they're white. If they were black, they would have never been accepted that quick into the country fold.\n\nAnd there have been plenty of white pop artists that have crossed over into the country charts, like Olivia Newton-John, Jewel, and plenty of others. Yet nobody ever whined about them being on there, and yet white artist still do that with no whines or complaints about them doing the same thing Beyonce has done. Nope, apparently it's only a problem when black artists do it. So stop trying to twists things around and acting as if the very bringing up of the existence of racism is racist---that's just straight-up stupid as hell, and it's always been a reality that black people have had to deal with. You're just pissed off that it's even brought up in the first place--you need to ask yourself why, instead of just whining about it because you didn't want to hear it.\n\nI guess you forgot that part of the Grammys where the head of the Grammy voting committee had to explain how there had been changes over the past few years---especially since there have been other black artists complaining over the years about how they feel that black artists didn't get enough recognition at the Grammys. Heck the Grammys didn't even acknowledge that hip-hop existed until the early '90s, when it had already been around for just over a decade.\n\nAnyway, Beyonce won, so get over and stop whining and complaining about it yourself. I'm still loving the fact that she finally won, and that she deserved it, lol. That isn't just my opinion, it's a damn fact, which is backed up by her having won in the first place.",

    "Let's be real----the average person dosen't know who most of these artists are, because the ones who sing country don't get promoted or played anywhere on radio stations as much as white country artists do.  I only found out about them by looking up black country singers online. Staples, Staton, Howard, and Chapman are the better known names only because they were already famous for singing gospel, R&B and rock. Mickey Guyton has been very open in the last few years about the decade she spent struggling to make in it country music, and the racism she had to deal with along the way.\n\nI remember coming across some videos she made a decade ago while looking up black country singers to see if I could find any, and ended up liking her voice after listening to a couple of them---she was still pretty unknown back then. I liked her voice, but I thought, \"She's not gonna get pushed or promoted in country music like these white artists always do because she's black,\" and that did turn out to be the case, until a few years back. Here, Guyton discusses how Beyonce's album did help put a spotlight on current little-known black country singers, and also challenged why more black people aren't in country music--it damn sure isn't for lack of talent, or hat black folks don't like it, because some of us do: [Mickey Guyton talks country music and Beyonce](https://www.essence.com/entertainment/mickey-guyton-bmac-black-country-music/)\n\nOh, and Linda Martell was forced to cut her career in country music short after one album, even after having a hit; performing on the Hee-Haw country music show, being the first black female country artist to perform at the Grand Ole Opry, because of the constant blatant racism she got from white country audiences, and because her record producer, a white guy who was outside of the Nashville mainstream, decided it would be easier to just kick her to the curb and promote a white country singer. Here's her story, her struggles, and how Beyonce put her on Cowboy Carter to give her props for being a pioneer: [Who Is Linda Martell? All About The Singer Featured On Beyonce's Album Cowboy Carter ](https://people.com/who-is-linda-martell-country-singer-beyonce-album-8621868)\n\nThe podcast Color Me Country, created and hosted by Rissi Palmer, is named after one of Martell's songs, Color Him Father. Palmer herself wound up leaving the country music biz after only one album, and has since admitted that it was partly because of the racism she had to deal with, too. She's since gone indie and made a couple of albums on her own, while using her podcast to put a spotlight on not just black country singers, but other country singers of color, too. Here's what Palmer had to say about how country music dosen't really support balck artists---black female artists in particular---as much as they do white artists, and uncovering a forgotten, and hidden history of black woman in country music: [https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/06/21/rissi-palmer-black-women-artists-country-music/74163427007/](https://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/columnists/2024/06/21/rissi-palmer-black-women-artists-country-music/74163427007/)",
    "Uh, no-----it's because for the longest time country music pretty much ignored black country artists and never accepted them. Yeah, they let Charley Pride in the door, but that's mainly because he was selling a lot of records, and didn't rock the boat, so to speak. And it was the usual case of, they had their one black person, and that was all they needed. \n\nI used to like some country songs as a child, but as I grew up, it became harder to really like country as a whole when I never saw any country artists who looked like me, and there's the fact that country music itself was always associated with racist rednecks who hated black folks, and deliberately shut them out of the country music business for years--making it seem like country music was exclusively for white people and white people only---which it was, for a long as hell while, and for too damn long, to be honest. \n\nMore black country artists have been coming up in the last decade, which has been great to see, and aren't keeping quiet about how ingrained the racism in the country music business really is toward black artists even today. Heck, in the last decade the country music gatekeepers have been accused of not even giving female country artists enough play on radio station, and prioritizing male country singers over them. Talk about going backwards. \n\nHere's an interview with country singer/songwriter Frankie Staton, who started the Black Country Music Association back in the '90s, along with singer Cleve Francis, as a platform to help black country musicians get a foothold into the business, and what a difficult struggle it was, since Nashville pretty much ignored them,and had no interest in pushing black country singers at all, no matter how talented they were, she said. Which is why the BCMA only lasted barely a decade. There's a Rolling Stone article from a few years back that goes into more depth about them, but Staton talks about managing to carve out a space in country music as a songwriter, dealing with yep, racism, even just for trying to be a songwriter, and the impact Beyonce's Cowboy Carter has had on country music for black country musicians in the article from last year:\n\n[Frankie Staton On Building a Future For Black Country Musicians](https://floodmagazine.com/154727/frankie-staton-feature/)",

    "is it tho",
    "music is subjective and beyonc\u00e9 won for best album for a reason. her album tells a story and is a compilation of songs that come together to form a narrative. i stand by the fact that it was deserved and that she has been snubbed in the past due to racism. the academy also doesn\u2019t go based on whether the song is \u201cgood\u201d or not it\u2019s also about the artist\u2019s accomplishments on the charts, how the album comes together, and whether the music has true quality or not. beyonc\u00e9 has dealt with racism in the past and she continues to as well. i want you to go take a look at twitter and see some of the racist shit people HAVE actually posted after her wins. not all the haters are racist, but there is no denying that racism has played a major part in the hate she has gotten throughout the years and also the discrimination she has faced in the industry. no one else is getting as much hate as beyonc\u00e9 after the grammy\u2019s even though so many other artists also beat out billie eilish and others.",
    "Changed what game? You think cowboy Carter changed the face of country music? You drinking the same kool-aid as the trumpers?",
    "I don\u2019t feel like she \u201creclaimed\u201d anything. She essentially made a pop album with some country typical instruments, threw some big name country legends on it and called it a day. If anything, she took away from black female artists that are true country artists. They are the ones we should be recognizing. Not someone who has been famous for the last 20 years, and is making the switch because country is cool right now.",
    "Yes",
    "All that\u2019s being said, is that her awards were bought. You are defending the win\u2026and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m black, and have walked this planet much longer than you. I\u2019ve experienced racism. And I\u2019m very aware of our history. But, when I commented my opinion, your FIRST response to me is, \u201cAre you white?\u201d\n\nYou basically lost credibility when you asked that. Why? Because you asked that, and were fully prepared to lecture me about oppression because you thought I was white. \n\nThis is why I\u2019m telling you to just stop. Please, stand up for our rights as black people, but don\u2019t boo hoo and make it sound like Beyonce is struggling through horrible oppression. Or that racism is the primary reason she is getting this hate.\n\nHer husband threw an embarrassing fit last year, and this year she wins? You think it\u2019s all a coincidence?\n\nMoney and power can buy just about anything. That\u2019s what occurred. And as much as you want to say Cowboy Carter told a story or whatever,,,,,it shouldn\u2019t have been the winner.\n\nBut it was. And we will all move on. But just know, that very few people think she deserved it. Not because of her color, but because the content of her album was not that great. Not at all.  Beyonce will live the rest of her life under the shadow of this award. Because, although her and Jay think they earned it\u2026.few others think she did.",
    "LOL, yeah I didn't see anything special about it, and I personally hated that Texas Holdem song.",
    "Not only country music, music in general. Her album did in fact change country music because it not \u201cconventional\u201d country music. She is arguably the most influential female artist of our time and so many female artists would say that she is their idol and has influenced their work immensely.",
    "In 2016 when she performed her county song, Daddy lessons from her album lemonade at the CMAs with the chicks and she felt not welcome but she still decided to summit the the song for best country song at the Grammys but they told her that it wasn\u2019t eligible. So she went to work and worked on two albums, which are now act one Renaissance and act to Cowboy Carter, but the thing is Cowboy Carter was supposed to be at Act One and Renaissance supposed to be Act Two but because of the pandemic, she felt that it would\u2019ve been best to release Renaissance first to lifted people up and it\u2019s true because her last track on Cowboy Carter transitions into the first track on Renaissance.\n\nSo when was time to release act two she already did the work, the proof is in the album. Not only that had three country legends: Linda Martell, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson she also brought on five young black country artist: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts and Shaboozey who\u2019s music  numbers boosted after the release, especially Shaboozey who\u2019s song, A Bar Song(Tipsy) just entered its 27th week surpassing the weekends, blinding lights. Beyonc\u00e9 was also promoting the girls, especially putting their names on billboards. Wow promoting the album which all of them said, help them gain new fans. \n\nAnd because of her album of the year win they just won their first Grammy. And she dedicated her win to Linda Martell.\n\nThe album is very thought out with from the instruments being played by Stevie Wonder harmonica, Paul McCartney and Nile Rodgers on guitar and Rhiannon Giddens on the Banjo to the fact that each song is it own reimagined version of a western film.  \n\nThe album is predominantly country with a blend of Americana, pop, blues, folk, classic rock, hip hop and R&B and because of her Texan roots she also blended in zydeco, rock and roll, psychedelic soul, rhythm and blues, funk, gospel, bluegrass, opera, rock, honky-tonk and go-go. And also international musical elements as well like Flamenco, funk Carioca and Irish folk. Hence her saying this is an a country album. It\u2019s a Beyonc\u00e9 album and on track 12, Linda Martell says the line \u201cgenres is a funny little concept\u201d and on track 19 saying \u201c this particular tone stretches across arrange a genres and that what makes it a unique listen\u201d \n\nSo don\u2019t act like she just woke up one day and wanted to do a country album without knowing the history, there\u2019s a woman putting in the work and credit everyone that was involved with the album and that including the songwriters and producers of songs that she sampled for the album. This is the same woman that credit her husband on a song for just clapping.",
    "I found the comment that expressed exactly how I felt; word for word.\n\nIt would have been a better move to include people she felt were being ignored in country music so she could boost them as well as herself and find some credibility on the way. Instead it feels like she's reaching for credibility by including all these big names in country which kind of makes the album feel nepo. This also does kind of feel like a revenge album, and does feel a little forced because it still feels like a pop album with country elements. And it's not like Taylor Swift hasn't done the same, but Beyonce is supposed to be a leader, not a follower.\n\nBut on the other side, the album in and of itself is a statement, and that's enough for me. If this doesn't prove that the grammys is rigged and that she should have won before, and that it's a pity award for messing up, I don't know what would.",
    "there\u2019s no way of knowing if she bought the awards or not. idc if i lost credibility this is reddit not a dissertation \ud83d\udc80. she still has faced discrimination and i stand by that. ignoring that discrimination creates a narrative that her career has been a breeze, which it hasn\u2019t. her awards are deserved, she is genuinely the best vocalist of this generation and i stand by that as well. agree to disagree i guess. just because i\u2019m young doesn\u2019t mean i don\u2019t understand how society and the world works. i still stand by everything i hv said and if you disagree that\u2019s fine, beyonc\u00e9 stays winning and that\u2019s a fact.",
    "There'd be no reason to watch the award shows if the winner was the artist with the most plays in x category.",
    "the grammys have always and will always be an industry networking event that aligns around celebrating artists who have been successful that year. you might find a curveball winner every now and again (arcade fire with the suburbs, for example), but it\u2019s predominantly an industry event to mingle and pat each other on the back.",
    "I agree with you completely.  With that said, I was stunned that Sierra Ferrell won 4 Grammys--because she was the artist who most captured my attention in 2024.  But I feel that in the ignored categories (like Bluegrass and alternative country), the nominations tend to be more based on merit because, frankly, most people have never heard of the artists in those categories.",
    "You think the Grammys are about artistic merit? lmao",
    "Alright I'll play. \n\nDefine \"artistic merit\" for me.",
    "I mean, I\u2019m sure the recording academy has that defined. It\u2019s why their members are composed of artists and members in the industry. If what they wanted was award the numbers they would all be streaming and radio executives .",
    "What makes a particular song or album good? I'm sure you like some songs that I don't like and vice versa, so clearly two people can have different ideas of good music. Art is subjective, there is no scientific measure of \"good.\" The very concept of \"quality\" is a matter of endless philosophical discussion. What *is* quality? \n\nI don't have a problem with artistic awards, but I think it quickly becomes a problem if people take it too seriously. I don't think it's possible to define something like art with rational language, which makes the whole thing kinda silly. I'm not saying we shouldn't do it, but I think the harder we look at it, the less sense it makes.",

I mean I'm no super fan or anything but I think if you listen to a couple of songs on one album like say, The Slow Rush and then a few on another like on Lonerism or something they sound pretty different?\n\nEven more differences and options if you include the song being talked about in this article that he did with Justice or any of the ones he does for various things like the D&D song or barbie song he did. \n\nA lot of em do have a certain feel to em that you'd find in any psychedelic rock song but I think a good number of em are different sounding.",
