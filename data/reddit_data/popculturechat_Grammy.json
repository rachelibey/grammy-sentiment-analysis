    "if anything i thought her using her DJ to fill in the lines she was out of breath for was such a smart move, it made the whole performance more cohesive and also more obvious that it was live? like, they were both on stage with mics lol",
    "Anyone who\u2019s seen her Tiny Desk concert would never think that for a second. She\u2019s talented as *hell* man. There are hoards of untalented pop stars riding mommy and daddy\u2019s money train who can barely call themselves artists, but these dorks are all WeLL aCkShuALLy LoOk aT hEr MoUtH\n\n![gif](giphy|kZD8cN1MycfKw)",
    "I love Doechii so much",
    "It\u2019s so obvious she\u2019s singling live like what \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I love her",
    "People are just making excuses to hate now because anyone with eyes could see it was live?",
    "Doing that in good health already seems like a challenge but doing it sick??? Holy. I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next for her.",
    "To watch that performance and have any kind of critiques is wild \n\nIt was amazing",
    "LOL people are so dumb. She literally has the DJ she\u2019s talking about in the act and they go back and forth. I mean tbh no matter what some people will always think someone\u2019s lip synching.",
    "She ate this performance, and hoes are mad. Everyone intelligent knew she wasn\u2019t lip syncing. LMFAOO",
    "They\u2019re just hating because the DJ, Miss Milan, is present and CLEAR in the performance for \u201cDenial\u201d on the moving floor and they\u2019re CLEARLY going back and forth. They\u2019re just mad whoever they wanted didn\u2019t win. I mean\u2026someone said Beyonc\u00e9 is lazy because they\u2019re a crazy Billie Stan, mad Billie didn\u2019t win AOTY. You can say many things about Beyonc\u00e9\u2026lazy?! That\u2019s just a lie and hater nonsense. I hate how being a psycho stan is normalized and you can just say whatever you want",
    "She is a gorgeous specimen of a human in every way.",
    "it wasn\u2019t hard to realize that the performance was live",
    "Doechii being all...I got bronchitis...\n\n![gif](giphy|Her8HwkH9Fa3S)",
    "Ugh. I just love her so much. Go OFF Doechii",
    "I remember watching her perform \u201cWat U Sed\u201d with Isaiah Rashad at the 2021 BET awards and being absolutely blown away by how perfect and clean her vocals were (WHILE doing choreo of course). Just incredible breath control. And she\u2019s only gotten better! People really are stupid. If you know nothing about live vocal performances you should just shut up and enjoy the artistry lol",
    "I love her she\u2019s so hot, and I mean that in personality first and foremost, just so happens she\u2019s also physically stunning",
    "I\u2019m glad she stands up for herself on this. Many times artists let these comments slide. I would be pissed too if someone said I didn\u2019t do my performance live especially if I was sick!",
    "I don't blame her for being aggravated, but I hope she doesn't burn herself out on social media a la Chappell. I don't think it's coincidence that the celebs who seem well-adjusted are the ones who stay offline.",
    "I need people to learn the difference between a backing track and lipsyncing",
    "Why are artists always sick for important taped performances?",
    "You could hear her pant throughout the song and there were different voice inflections throughout. A lip synced performance would be too clean and missing the rawness. Lots of people use vocal fills or tracks to make the songs sound fuller. It\u2019s clear people don\u2019t understand how it works. Her performance was electric.",
    "It's so easy for people to sit on their couches and pick apart a performance! These trolls have zero understanding how much work and preparation goes into something like this. I am glad Doechii responded even though she shouldn't have to prove herself whatsoever. She is an unbelievable performer and artist.",
    "I hate that she even felt the need to respond to such obvious nonsense.",
    "it was painfully obvious to me it was live, the girl needs to breathe!!!!",
    "People said the same thing about Benson Boone's performance which was also obviously live \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

    "So stupid. The public finds someone famous and good and just says \"let's fuck with her\"",
    "I\u2019m in love with her \ud83e\udd70",
    "People be complaining about anything these days. Not worth responding to everything",
    "She\u2019s talented for sure but going to an event to spread the flu is definitely a choice",
    "i love her with all my heart lol",
    "I refuse to let people come for my girl like that. No, she actually can sing live. Sorry folk for this who don\u2019t know what talent is.",
    "Do people really not know that a lot of artists do that",
    "ridiculous criticism in the first place esp when a lot of SINGERS, not even rappers, use backing tracks to help with vocals. it was so clear with her breathing and placement she was rapping live.\n\nalso her skin is god damn flawless.",
    "Responding to everyone on social media is what sends these stars into an emotional tailspin. Why is it so difficult to ignore?",
    "Dummies",
    "Doechii!!! Don't question this badass.",
    "Yeah tell them, she killed her performance",
    "I know it's not the point but she's so stunning. Like ugh imagine being that smart, funny, articulate and just beautiful",
    "I expect a fire song out of this, Doechii.",
    "Lmao I love her. It's so obvious she was singing live because you could even hear her breathing at times. She did amazing and some people really need to being overly negative about promising performers.",
    "As someone with chronic bronchitis, I struggle with even getting a sentence out while talking on the phone or in person when I\u2019m sick, let alone performing and dancing on the Grammys! My respect for her just went up 100 fold with this! WOW! (And I\u2019ve already become a fan from her performance at the Grammys and being an out queer woman).",
    "Also, how is she not blue checked on TikTok yet?! wtf?!",
    "People are truly dumb I agree \nIt\u2019s actually so fucking tiring seeing people who don\u2019t know shit act like they know how live performances work",
    "Literally HOW with bronchitis! I have it now and there\u2019s a coughing fit every ten mins. I need to know her magic! She\u2019s amazing.",
    "Seriously, do people not understand live performances? Even when it's not someone else you can't see on stage signing the live parts, you should be able to tell when they're singing and when it's just recorded audio. It's not like they're trying to fool the audience.",
    "They can never make me hate Doechii.",
    "I love her \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23",
    "I hope she\u2019s okay, that looks like a hospital room setting",
    "It was SO obviously live!!! This isn\u2019t speaking to the use of performance tracks, this is about her, and that was SO live. Her DJ filled in a very smart way, and she\u2019s talking over her own track! She isn\u2019t trying to hide those dubs. She\u2019s performing.",
    "Seriously if you didn\u2019t notice her DJ (Milan, a talent in her own right), that was a you problem lol, she was pretty prominently featured in the performance right up in the front next to Doechii",
    "That's what I thought too. Also I don't want to hear sick voice on stage. It's enough she was even there.",
    "Good point! \u00a0That Tiny Desk concert was an amazing showcase of her artistry and how seamlessly her band and dj support each song.\u00a0",
    "Pop stars mind you while Doechii is up there rapping her face off and doing serious choreography and acrobatics. That level of breath control is hard to fathom.",
    "the simping is crazy",
    "So excited for someone new and so mother fucking talented",
    "People give too much credit to online comments. Like it\u2019s probably a twelve year old boy.",
    "And ears",
    "Good lord if anybody out there considers Beyonce lazy, I dread to think what they\u2019d consider me lmao. Wild how ppl\u2019s music taste literally distorts reality \ud83d\udc80",
    "Doechii has been rising up in the scene for a bit longer. Her song Yucky Blucky Fruitcake was a pandemic hit and she got her first platinum song 2 years ago. I think her recent album is a reflection on the burn out stage",
    "Long days, hard work, little sleep, high stress levels and constantly going around and being in the vicinity of a lot of other people who may carry whatever kind of bugs. Not sure but a performance like that takes a ton of prep, I\u2019m sure the whole proces is exhausting and not that great for your health.",
    "Right?? I wish working while sick wasn\u2019t normal. The flu is really bad this year",
    "She's so incredible people literally can't believe it. I love her so much--she's so unique and so cool, she's resetting the bounds of what's possible. Her blackness and her intentional performance of it is so beautiful. Same goes for her femininity and her sheer brilliance.\n\nJfc what a badass. Low key crush.",
    "I was in awe when I saw it! Doechii gives me chills. I\u2019ve seen her tiny desk so many times now. So good.",
    "and she did it all with bronchitis!!!! I am all aboard the Doechii train, she\u2019s a phenomenal talent and the girls who get it, get it",
    "That you Azalea Banks?",
    "I\u2019m not even really a fan of Beyonc\u00e9 and I would fight someone if they said she was lazy. lol",
    "Not to mention being in enclosed spaces with lots of crew/ staff, the press run, etc. stress and exposure to people and germs you usually are t exposed to.",
    "I understand her working while sick in this case lol. It\u2019s the Grammys.",
    "I agree with everything you said 100%. And also high key crush over here lollll",
    "I understand but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s responsible",
    "You got downvoted for this, but I totally agree.",
    "Yeah I\u2019m already well aware most people don\u2019t care. I thought we learned in 2020 but I guess not",

    "Best performance of the night! Incredible!",
    "She\u2019s absolutely electric. i haven\u2019t seen a rapper with choreo in awhile.",
    "She\u2019s so fricking awesome",
    "Amazing performance. You can tell she's a theater kid",
    "mouth was hanging open the entire performance\u2026she\u2019s the real deal!",
    "So good",
    "I\u2019m in love.",
    "Carrying around a giant wad of cash just for tipping must feel great.",
    "Notice she asks first - \"are you allowed to accept tips?\"\u00a0\nThat clearly shows she does this regular. Lots of places in the UK don't allow you to accept tips, when working retail/hospitality/service jobs.. she wants to show her appreciation, but ensures she doesn't get them in trouble too. Pretty classy.",
    "Do you think she has pre-rolled 20s and 50s in her bag for tipping opportunities?",
    "I know people might think this is performative, but good for her. Too many wealthy celebrities are known for not tipping or barely tipping at all (I understand they\u2019re for the event and it\u2019s not obligated but still).",
    "She's always done stuff like this tbh\n\nI remember years ago she ran into some girls at central park who were fans and they told her they were going to chipotles so she handed them cash too",
    "Guys it\u2019s not performative anymore if it\u2019s done consistently over decades. lol\n\nShe literally tipped her crew a 100k. Like come on now.",
    "Taylor has been consistently praised as always respecting and paying the people around her extremely well. Since she was a teenager she has a track record of being generous and friendly to all staff. \n\nShe knows that\u2019s not good enough for some people, as it\u2019s still perceived as performative (*covert narcissism disguised as altruism*). But she continues to do it, consistently and also privately - where it\u2019s not recorded.\n\nSo many rich or famous people are stingy little ego fucks who don\u2019t tip or respect us peasants, and they just get called iconic rockstars or divas for asshole behavior. Taylor has polite manners to service workers and people still find a way to be BEC about it \ud83d\ude44\n\nPerfection is the enemy of good enough and all that.",
    "Not the people getting pressed in the comments \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\n\nI have relatives who live in the united states, and these hefty tips from celebs cover anything from a week's groceries to your standard wifi/frugal electricity bill. Stop shitting on people getting the bag.",
    "Isn\u2019t she known for being incredibly generous with her money? And not publicising it? Like donating to go fund me\u2019s and food banks etc? I know it\u2019s becoming a trend to hate on Taylor but I say good for her!",
    "Good for her! If I were a billionaire, id be doing stuff like this too.",
    "She tipped even her truck drivers thousands extra each. I would do the same if I'd be a billionaire",
    "For people saying this is \"PR\" or staged, i'd say look at the context: There is an extensive history of stories about her doing things like this over the years, and we don't see videos every time. She did it very quickly as she was walking by, so it makes sense there isn't always footage of it. This time someone was already filming as celebrities walked by them, and got it on camera. Not everything needs to be a conspiracy, sometimes people just do nice things.",
    "i am sure everyone is going to act normal about this",
    "[removed]",
    "Love her or hate her, but the way it\u2019s been widely reported how well she treats her crew and staff while on tour, I genuinely think she\u2019s a decent person.",
    "I swear to god that Taylor could find a cure to every known cancer and people would still say it\u2019s performative and that she\u2019s only doing it because it\u2019s a disease that affects her personally.\n\nIs being gracious to workers just basic human decency? Absolutely. But I\u2019m sure the money and kindness was appreciated regardless and it\u2019s not \u201cperformative\u201d because someone who is constantly being filmed was caught being nice on camera. My lord.",
    "I am not a fan of hers for a million reasons, but I fuck with this heavily.\n\nI'm poor and I find a lot of joy in charity and I always wondered why you never saw the ultra rich doing more things like this.\n\nIf I was rich, it would make me so happy to be slipping $100s to people everywhere. I'd be like a Grandma giving you a hidden five dollar bill in front of your mom.",
    "I must say, she\u2019s good like that. Generous",
    "She does a lot and doesn\u2019t have to! She doesn\u2019t get enough credit for her kind heart. She could keep all of that money and still have all the fans!",
    "I recently worked an event at a club. Like a social club. And I cannot tell you how many people came up to me and said thank you for keeping us safe. Thank you for being on the lookout. Really appreciate you. And even that was really nice because you think you\u2019re just a fly on the wall, keeping the floors clean or keeping weirdos out of the VIP. But some degree it is  appreciated and that\u2019s kind of nice.",
    "i\u2019m honestly so over the taylor-hate-train. obv her artistry isn\u2019t for everyone, but damn she seems to be a genuinely nice person. she doesn\u2019t give off fake vibes either. taylor is consistent afaik.",
    "Women billionairs like taylor or MacKenzie Scott do this and men (and some pick me women brainwashed by patriarchy) buy islands full of children, white houses and nazis.\n\nYall will never be able to convince me that a matriarchy wouldnt be the superior social system",
    "As a long time fan what keeps her as my number one popstar is not just the great music and hard work but the fact that she has time and again proven to be a nice human. Sure, everyone in the limelight can falter on certain fronts but there are some really horrible famous people and I am glad she isn't one of them.",
    "Kudos to her - it\u2019s nothing to her but could mean a lot to hospitality workers",
    "I may not like her music, but if I had her money I wish I could do the same",
    "Aww the workers sound so grateful. This made me happy",
    "There's no winning with Taylor Swift haters. She's a really cool and nice person.\n\n\n\nThe haters can fuck off.",
    "I\u2019ve been a fan of her since the early days. She used to randomly give fans on Tumblr money whenever they mentioned they were struggling. She\u2019s been incredibly generous since day one, well before anyone was looking at her to call it performative.",
    "Fun fact. I\u2019ve never seen Trump tip anyone. Also one never seen him pay his bills.",
    "I honestly don\u2019t understand people who are angry about this. Even IF it is performative, she\u2019s still giving service workers hefty tips. Isn\u2019t that better than not tipping?",
    "Jlo would never \ud83d\ude29",
    "Reminds me of Amandaland lol, \"anyone here like \u00a320 notes?\"\n\nNice gesture though, I bet the haters hate it",
    "Some billionaire artist even refuse to pay their own workers, so it's nice to see a celebrity actually do visible real good with their money that skips the middle man of \"charities\" and just give back to the people you know aren't getting paid shit.",
    "Not a fan of her music but she\u2019s a good person, very kind and generous!!",
    "Taylor\u2019s just a kind person, she really does not deserve the hate.",
    "Class act. TYSM and a look in the eyes",
    "Not to mention for the fires she posted the organizations she donated to - 11 of them I believe I counted - and did not mention how much she donated. Just that those were the ones she chose and you could donate to them too if you felt like it and could. I love that.",
    "I think this is genuine, and I adore her for it.",
    "More people who are able to do that should.",
    "Here come all the TSwift complainers in 3..2..1",
    "Listen say what you will about Taylor Swift, but it says a lot of people even someone who is famous as her, if they are able to go the extra mile to tip so good for her.",
    "It would make my day to get a tip from her this is very sweet!",
    "I mean she did give major bonuses to the workers from her Eras tour so im not surprised. Perhaps it\u2019s performative but at least they got tipped for their hard work at the event",
    "You know what, I didn\u2019t really think anything of Taylor Swift either way a year or so back. I just had her down as this generation\u2019s answer to Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears.\n\nHaving seen/learned a bit more, I have to say that I think she is a fantastic person and an absolutely brilliant role model not just for young girls, but for people as a whole.\n\nShe seems grounded, happy, does the right thing and just seems like a really good person.",
    "I know a lot of people will say she is just doing this for the camera but she is also generous to her staff and others in private. I think taking care of the people who take care of you is about the least a billionaire can do and too few of them do it.",
    "I swear, if someone made me rich, I would do that too.",
    "why do people dislike this woman",
    "I mean say what you want about her but she\u2019s always been know for being generous. Even at the start of her career. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s performative, she gave huge bonuses to the people who worked on her tour and she donates to like almost every cause. And not small donation either. \n\nIt\u2019s like the one thing about her that people should be allowed to criticize because she should be the example to follow not the exception to the rule. \n\nI had a friend work for J Lo a couple of years ago for some PR stuff and he said the vibe coming from her was that she thinks since she came from nothing and worked hard to get to this level and nobody handed her anything that people should work hard if they want something instead of asking people for help:money.",
    "Her head security guard moves with such grace. He\u2019s fascinating to watch as he shadows her.",
    "ome thing I appreciate a lot about taylor is that she really values the industry she's in, but like, collectively. it's clearly not just the artists, but stage folks, tour truck drivers, security staff at venues, record store employees ,etc.\n\n\nwe know she values her team a lot (many have been with her for years), dancers and musicians, but it's very important to value less visible parts of the entertainment industry.\n\n\nand i don't care either way if she's photographed doing it or not, but maybe this makes another rich celeb go like \"hm i guess i should tip the staff at the venue\" because it had never crossed their mind. then the staff receives more tips and that's what actually matters",
    "Jesus, people in these commments are so ridiculous with your \"I don't like her but...\" \"her music sucks, but...\" \"I'm def not a Swiftie but...\"\n\nYou dont have to preface your compliment with a disclaimer so that \\*\\*god forbid\\*\\* no one accidentally thinks you might be a fan! You can just say something nice about someone. You won't die.",
    "I don't know why people hate her so much. She seems really generous and even in this video, everyone else walked by these hardworking people like they were invisible but she stopped and talked to them and showed some appreciation for them. I'm sure Taylor has her flaws, like every other human being, but she seems pretty generous and actually cares about the world around her. She went to that children's hospital around Christmas then sent them all gifts, she donates to food banks and other great causes. As wealthy celebrities go, I think she's alright.",

    "Look, I despise her music, it\u2019s not for me whatsoever. But almost everything I\u2019ve heard about her doing, the way she carry\u2019s herself in interviews or fan interactions, she seems to be one of the extremely rare 0.0000001% of ultra wealthy human beings that corruption and greed hasn\u2019t taken ahold of yet and that\u2019s good enough for me she\u2019s one of, if not the only billionaire on the planet I\u2019d gladly shake hands with and thank them for what they do.",

It's still a generous gesture.\n\nI still prefer performative kindness over the opposite. \n\nIf I find myself in a group of people who booh her more than they booh a greedy, stingy, toxic, vicious tyrant .. then I know I am in a group with stupid priorities.\n\nYes, I know that the audience at the sportsgame booed her because they're unhappy with which sports team she supports. Like I said; stupid priorities.",

It\u2019s just insane what she\u2019s had to go through and, yet, she hasn\u2019t seemed to have lost herself with it",
    "not even 1% of her wealth but my Mother is very generous and even on her own pension she tips people who help her with any chores and for good meals at restaurants... one day I asked her why she tips that much and she told me that she knows the value of hardwork, skill and hospitality. She went on assert that it is her money that she uses for tipping and it should be none of our business :)",
    "Regardless of what's said about her, or even some people booing her, she gets it done. And sets a great example. Even if it is performative, which I don't think it is, it's a nice thing. We need more of that.",

And even benefitting from it, she still thinks it is important to recognize the people who do the work it takes to make her life possible. Famous and rich or not, she is still just some woman. And if I saw some woman do this, in any other scenario and if it was anyone else, I would think well of them. It must be nice having that money, but there are a lot worse ways I know she could be spending it than supporting working people. It's easy for rich people to donate large amounts to a charity and still be pieces of shit. I have yet to find someone who is a shitty person and also takes the time to thank and tip the person sweeping the floors after they leave.",

    "I'm a non-American & I have a question related to this. \n\nIn the UK our homeless people have complained about how difficult it is to get money from people these days. Barely anyone carries cash anymore, everything is paid via card or apps. Its that rare to need cash we get a surprise if we're told something is cash only & have to run to find a cash machine as it's not worth always having cash on us. \n\nIs it similar in the US? And have people in jobs like this clip where they rely on cash, found they are no longer receiving as much in tips due to lack of cash? \n\nI can see people in services jobs where card payments are already the norm may be doing OK as you can add a tip to your bill. And you can add a tip to an uberfood or justeat delivery. But what about people like in this clip, or the people in hotels who carry your bags, or bring your room service? \n\nOr is cash still very much a widely used thing in the US for this reason?",
    "She\u2019s a famous billionaire lol. Ain\u2019t no way she would tip that low. That would look bad. Most likely she\u2019s tipping 100.",

    "The exact sort of performatism where everyone wins, tbh. Let billionaires be pressured into handing out cash to people earning 50c an hour",
    "Like after seeing so many billionaires giving bare minimum after the fires, i support any kind of act of giving to people",
    "She's always been known for giving tips + bonuses to everyone who works for her though. It's not hard to just accept she's a caring person. People always have to create an ulterior motive/narrative with Taylor for some reason lol, maybe she's just.... nice?",
    "I\u2019m not fan of Taylor but it\u2019s really no winning tbh.  She does it in front of cameras or announces it and it\u2019s \u201cshe\u2019s so performative, they never do it secretly\ud83d\ude12\u201d but then if she doesn\u2019t do it in front of cameras it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019d like Taylor to do some charity for once\ud83d\ude44.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s still a billionaire but idk people would complain when these workers still got paid by her.",

If she wants to give back some of her wealth in the form of some $100 bills to working class people, I say let her. It costs her nothing but may be a huge deal to the recipient. \n\nAs long as it\u2019s real money I say perform away!",

I wasn\u2019t even main crew but our catering was all paid for out of her pocket, and she donated \u00a350k to charities that help fight poverty in that city, and every other city she performed at in the UK. \n\nSay what you want about the private jets she uses, legitimate criticism, but she puts her money where her mouth is at least, and looks after people. She\u2019s got the money to do so and she does.\n\nStill don\u2019t like her music, but she seems to be a better person than the internet makes her out to be",

United dude instead cheating on his wife and killing people for profit? Whatever she gave them prob covered a day of food, a bill, gas for a week, and people have the nerve to call it performative when she\u2019s been doing this for 15 years?",

Not all \u201ccelebrities\u201d were raised like assholes.\n\nEDIT: and if you still think all that is performative, I just think that means you\u2019ve never had a boss or guest have respect t for you enough to give you a bonus/tip.",

    "Exactly! So what if it benefits her plus them and hurts no one!",
    "It's a win-win.  Charity is a win-win.  She gets to look like the good guy, they get a little extra to do what they want.  Nobody is hurt.  Love it.",

    "And you know what even if it's performative as long as she's doing something good and not holding it over people's heads it's all good. People are so worried about reasons not to be good instead of just doing good stuff and dealing with the consequences that don't matter at all",
    "Nah, the way she has money ready to go, asks them if they can accept tips and then discreetly hand them some money show this is part of her routine. Hate her or not, this is some classy shit to do.",

I forget if it was a fan or maybe a journalist but someone complimented her purse and she just emptied it and let them have it. \n\nAnd on her birthday at the children\u2019s hospital when people dragged her for wearing an expensive outfit and she sent a little girl the same outfit a few days later because the little girl complimented it. \n\nOr the 10M she donated for victims of the LA fires. \n\nI will never understand the hate for this woman. She doesn\u2019t have to do any of the things she does and is so overly criticized and ripped apart for no reason.",

    "What I struggle with is people\u2019s binary perception of celebrities as entirely good vs entirely evil. Taylor, like like the vast majority of people, does good things and bad things. She is nuanced. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to frown upon her private jet usage while simultaneously appreciating her being generous to staff.",
    "How would she go about NOT tipping performatively, though? (Not actually asking you, personally, just the world at large.) Everywhere she goes, there are cameras.

The world is better because she\u2019s in it.\n\nEdit: Annnnd now there\u2019s so much hatred below this comment, grasping at straws and misinformation.

She values people's work and what they do behind the scenes and even the little things they do that people don't even realize. I'm glad her employees and the people around her are appreciated",

During Covid she gave away smaller sums of money directly to fans (like $13,000 because she loves the number 13).  I believe she also paid for health insurance for the employees of a record store in Nashville during Covid. She gave her Eras tour truck drivers a $100,000 bonus each.

    "Me too. She shows genuine respect to others, whether they are service people, other artists, her team or her fans. There are so many examples of this and just one that directly affected me and everyone that went to Eras - she started at the specified time, every night, unless there was a *force majeure* totally out of her control. This shows respect for other people\u2019s time and energy.\n\nThat along with all the charities she has supported (mostly silently), her behaviour to her team and all of these random acts of kindness, make me proud to call myself a fan.",

She probably does more than any artist of her fame and popularity",

I'm sure there are plenty of problems people can have with her for various reasons, but stfu about her doing acts of kindness.  Jeez.",

She\u2019s gotten unbelievably rich(er) in the past 4 years and it seems she at the very least tries to give back.",

Taylor Swift can be bothered, at least some of the time. Kudos to her.",

    "Given she\u2019s followed by cameras and phone cameras I don\u2019t think she could do that quietly",

Yes, I know the song is repetitive and the lyrics are simple. But I can\u2019t help but sing it in my head every time a thread like this one comes up. People who are determined to hate her will find a reason to complain about her no matter what she does. It must be so exhausting to have people pick apart every single thing you do. She has no choice to but to shake it off, because internalizing that constant, undeserved hatred would destroy a person.",

    "Sure and I agree with that sentiment. But I still stand by saying it\u2019s not performative. I think generally in American culture it\u2019s a crutch and defensive reaction to call out charity as performative but even beyond that deeper cultural issue - if something is a habit done consistently over time it ceases to be performative.",

And I know the Eras tour was making large food pantry donations in each city. It's not nothing. We can argue the ethics of being a billionaire or her carbon footprint or whatever, but those things are a net good.",

I don't know if it's youth/immaturity (bc that is something you learn as you age) or what but it's kind of wild. The world never was and never will be black and white and neither will any single thing in it. The world exists exclusively in shades of grey. People online *strongly* resist this fact it's nuts",
    "And it also should be noted her private jet usage does not even register in the charts of top private jet celeb flights. Even during her tour. \n\nShe was a scapegoat for that, because her name gets more engagement than for example Celine Dion or Beyonc\u00e9, who were actually in the top 10. The actual top guy? Can\u2019t remember his name. Cause no one brings it up, cause no one knows - cause it wasn\u2019t a headline to use his name. \n\nIt made better headlines to go after her, more clicks, more traffic, more ad views, better memes. Some people are salivating for any reason to jump on the hate train and the media fed them (the hate subs are extreme evidence of how desperate these folk are for a crumb of those crackers). \n\nBut yet no one ever brings up that those other celebs must also be criticized for their jets or whatever other potential wrong they\u2019ve done in every post praising them. It may happen to an extent - after some news hits or something - but it\u2019s not as pervasive. \n\nIt is a curiously Taylor thing, that people have to say \u201cI\u2019m not a fan but\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like her but\u201d \u201cthis was good but\u201d. \n\nOf course she\u2019s not a saint. Everyone is nuanced. But it\u2019s the way people have selective standards that\u2019s funny. Adding a moral and carbon footprint check to the end of every compliment. \n\n\nLike have at it, but give that energy for everyone. Hold every celeb to these standards. Direct the accusations to the right people. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just giving thumbs up to anyone being polite to service staff \ud83d\udc4d god knows normal people can\u2019t even manage a thank you half the time",

    "Yep. That\u2019s why it\u2019s *bitch eating crackers*. Doesn\u2019t matter which way anything is done, quietly or loudly, she\u2019s always just over there eating her fucking crackers.",
    "I think this is true. She got stuck in Florida during a hurricane once and instead of hunkering down with the other rich people she went to a nursing home and volunteered, keeping them entertained by singing, helping to serve food, etc etc",

    "Always have been the American dream. Service Workers depends on tips",
    "And while I hate to defend the 1% needlessly, a lot of her net worth is tied up in the value of her masters; that she\u2019s never going to want to sell. She probably doesn\u2019t have a billion dollars in liquid cash which some people seem to wilfully ignore. I\u2019m sure she has more money in her checking account than most of us could earn in 10 lifetimes, but people also need to conceptualise how many people the Taylor Swift\u2122 brand employs and supports too. Hundreds? Thousands? Security, assistants, house staff, managers, her family, drivers, band members, etc, and we\u2019ve heard from her staff that she pays well and has better benefits. \n\nYou have to be greedy to get the amount she has, and I\u2019m always for adequate taxation of the insanely rich, but people thinking celebs have millions and billions in liquid cash always irks me.",
    "Not just the truck drivers, right? Didn\u2019t she end up giving several million in total because she gave everyone from the tour a massive bonus?",
    "she also donated to hurricane helene, which is a lot more than a lot of celebs and rich people can say. appalachia pretty much got ignored",
    "She gave out a total of \\~$197,000,000 in bonuses for people who worked on the Eras tour.  Bonuses, to be clear, not contractual pay.",

Stop giving unless she gets people to sign NDAs to never mention it and intentionally make the world believe that she's uncharitable when it does seem to come naturally to her? That's weird AF. Some of things she does is like, human decency (she tips waiters! she's cleaning up other peoples' trash from the suite herself!), but even holding a door for an old lady is probably \"performative\" to these people if someone gets a photo of it.\n\nThis \"criticism\" isn't anything she needs to concern herself with because it seems to really only apply to her anyway.",
    "Agree",
    "I don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been a single story of someone claiming she was rude to them. Over a 20 year career that\u2019s extremely impressive.",
    "So happy you got to go to the tour! I also noticed this last year that she has hardly ever cancelled shows compared to other artists - none due to her own problems I think. She has the same backup singers and band for so many years, all her dancers praise her, I hardly hear anything bad from anyone who has interacted with her; all the hate I do read is speculative and projection. The only thing we can see her improve upon is being more climate conscious.",

He had left wads of money around the house and instead of taking it to the bank, I just tipped every hotel employee I saw, every day. It just felt so nice to be able to say thank you to the people who were helping me out during such a rough time. I am Italian and I watched my dad hand out wads of cash my whole life and it felt good to do it myself. Maintain my opinion that people who don\u2019t tip do not know what real joy feels like.",

My philosophy is that they obviously need it more than I do at the moment, and I rarely have more than $30 anyway, so I\u2019d rather give it to them vs. separating or saying something callous about getting change for them. At least I can help them now, because I may not be able to in the future.",
    "She also donates to food banks in every city she performs.",
    "She didnt give her truckers 100k she gave all of her roadies 100k. Thats about 200 people if not more lol",
    "Exactly.  I remember when she donated 100,000 to the Djs family who got shot at the chiefs parade after their Super Bowl win last year and people were so nasty saying she should\u2019ve donated more and I also read she donated 10 million to the people in LA for the wildfires.  She is a very kind and giving person apparently because she could\u2019ve done nothing.",
    "Yeah she was in town a few months ago and the hype was insane. Like, government getting involved and tons of news coverage and fans lined up before the sun came out to get merch.\n\nNow I'm a 37 year old dude, I have virtually no interest in Taylor Swift, but I couldn't believe the amount of people my age that were bothered by it.\n\nLike, even if you're not a fan, it's undeniable how much business she was bringing into town. And the stuff she's promoting are values like be nice to each other and loyal to good friends.\n\nWhy anybody is bothered by it, I just don't know.",
    "My buddy Is a stage hand for some huge venues in Denver. He has worked shows that were headlined by Taylor Swift, pink, and other big name artist. Pink didn\u2019t allow the stagehands and other workers too even look her away. She even requested at times for no one else be in the room with her.",
    "She also has lowered that jet use over the last two years while other celebrities have increased their use and don\u2019t get the same blowback or even brought into the private jet conversation much. Travis Scott comes to mind.",
    "Can you imagine the craziness if she actually went to an airport and flew commercial.",
    "And she\u2026 buys the carbon credits for it. She obviously isn\u2019t in a position to feasibly NOT fly private but she offsets it. At the same time what\u2019s the other option? She just NOT support climate change and stuff?

She's well known to be generous. I'm not a Swiftie, but I think it's cool that she takes care of her own staff and staff at these venues. Plus I read that her tour made huge food pantry donations at each stop for Eras, which I think is great. I would love to be able to afford to be really generous.\n\nI put myself through college with tips from a restaurant job.

The former is a standard industry practice at this point. As for the latter... sure, she travels too much. But I don't think people realize that if she wants to travel, she almost HAS to fly private.

What a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that the people who work behind the scenes for touring bands/musicians are essentially independent contractors, so they only get paid when they\u2019re on the road and have to find other gigs to fill the gaps if the band they usually work for is not currently touring. Some bands keep some of their crew on retainer and pay them an annual salary so they\u2019re available when needed for touring, but that\u2019s not the norm for the workers outside of the specialized tech roles.

Because Taylor has had so much income this year, she actually needs to make huge donations (if she wants the tax credit on it).  \n\nAlso, tipping workers is not a donation, and she can't deduct it.  In fact, she likely has to pay the gift tax on it in addition to normal income taxes. (in the US, the giver of a gift has to pay taxes instead of the reciever.

    "I think she\u2019s saying that they DON\u2019T have even that option. Labels likely don\u2019t offer any kind of healthcare coverage at all to artists whose work they depend on to make all that money. There are working class artists who aren\u2019t being properly compensated for their time or their art because they don\u2019t have health insurance through their employer (the labels).

I'm from EU, doesn't matter if I lose a job because the government provides insurance in that case, because they know it's cheaper to do that than to have a population with declining health that isn't being addressed or treated.\n\nIMHO every industry and your government need to be called out and pressured on this, not just the music industry.",

    "Exactly her point\u2026",
    "I'm seeing something similar in publishing and there are some new authors calling out publishers for not paying a livable wage. But most writers never were making much money from it. The myth/allure of the \"struggling artist\" exists for a reason. They were living out of their vans, working at bars, writing books/music on the side waiting to make it big. (Before that, they were sponsored by rich people.)\n\nBut it's so much harder to be that kind of artist today. Nobody can afford to go live alone in a cabin for a year to write the next great american novel or self fund their own tour. That's the real issue and it's not an industry problem, that's an overall cost of living problem. \n\nIt's good that young people today are more political and care more about things like universal healthcare and speak up about these things. But there's also a disconnect because with social media today anyone can be famous, and they all expect to be able to make money off their side hustle/ tik toks/ self published book/ garage band. It never worked like that, and it actually can't work like that. Not everyone can be a full-time artist. This isn't a dig on Chappell, but I'm just not sure who she means when she talks about emerging artists and how the industry is supposed to support every up and coming musician who maybe has a future hit.",

It was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized.

I wonder if the reason she's doing background vocals on Sour was because Dan Nigro was trying to get her covered employment so she could qualify for insurance.\n\nThe real issue is that she got dropped in 2020.  This both was horrible for her... it was also a really really stupid decision!  Atlantic lost a ton of money on her.  Island has made a fortune!  This is the year of breakout artists.  And yet... all these artists were \"in development' for a really long time.  Charli XCX was signed (to asylum) in 2010... she had it the easiest because she has written over the years a number of unbelievably big hits for other artists (I love it, and Senorita).  Sabrina Carpenter was first signed (to Hollywood Records) in 2015. Chappelle was signed to atlantic in 2015.  Gracie Abrams was signed in either late 2018 or early 2019.  So all of these artists have been working for years for record labels, making very little money (Charli did the best), and suddenly 10 years later they break out.  Both Sabrina and Chappelle have been on two different labels!  If this is how long it takes to break out, this isn't sustainable.",

So if labels had to start paying all of their artists $40k/ year or whatever, they would basically have to stop signing people (my first advance was something like 1000\u00a3).\n\nIf you got dropped from a contract where you were paid a small advance, you\u2019re not going to get signed to one where you have to be paid many times more for a longer period of time, with the funds not being tied to any performance metrics. \n\nBasically, a pretty huge amount of want-to-be entertainers don\u2019t really provide any real value to society, so treating them like factory workers, whose wage is tied to their real output doesn\u2019t really make sense.",
    "Yeah I mean my continuous issue with Chappell is while I probably agree with 90% of her politics, she makes a lot of poorly phrased political statements. People will not soundbite your intentions, plan accordingly (that's why most artists keep it vague and to rehearsed lines)\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I do care a LOT about this one. ESC is not the way, it's literally the problem. Don't throw ESC out there if you do not substantially and meaningfully ESC. And I cannot think of an industry where that makes less sense.\u00a0\n\n\nYour statement is 1000x better. She should have said that lol\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I really wouldn't care that much if she wasn't continually propped up as having better more concise speech than she does. People say she is 100% correct and it's like.....well her heart is in the right place. They say she doesn't miss and it's like.....she's always in the neighborhood. They say she's a socialist queen.....this is literally the exact opposite of socialism, this is actually a distinctly private market capitalist solution.\u00a0\n\n\nI just need people to stop getting so much of their policy rhetoric from a pop star. If this is meaningfully shaping the conversation, then we're fucked. I don't need musicians to be super into the details. But if the majority of online progressives don't see the incoherence with pushing for ESC in 2025 as a respond to the large scale unemployment of the pandemic..... we're fucking doomed as a nation.\u00a0",
    "That is very true, but the conversations surrounding the healthcare and health insurance industries need to continue to happen no matter who is talking about it, we need to keep talking about it because talking becomes actions. This is a right we must fight for so any and every conversation about it needs to happen and celebrities talking about it is important because the media will actually report on it, they aren\u2019t going to report on all the people complaining online about it. \n\nI think it\u2019s also important to note that Chappell may be super famous, a few years ago, she wasn\u2019t\u2026 so she probably doesn\u2019t have as much money as people thinks she does. Sure she makes a lot put she also has to pay a lot of people out of that AND cover her own healthcare. \n\nAlso, if celebrities are complaining about healthcare then you know it\u2019s getting to be a huge issue. \n\nEither way all these conversations about it are what eventually leads to change.. so the criticism is a bit counterproductive.",
    "Someone just listed the SAG entrance stuff and honestly it's better than what a lot of people deal with. Especially since union dues and health insurance are tax deductible. I'm willing to bet 2020 Chappell was making more than my mom and apparently had a way better insurance offer than my mom could get.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nIdk I do think her overall story is a good one. Ife gotten emotional at it before....but the way she's politicizing it feels out of touch and sour. Like this *is* fairly common stuff, and to frame this as anything other than a call to better collective bargaining seems disconnected. You think your employer is just gonna stip being a dick if you ask nicely? Pay your union dues and get organizing like the rest of us ma'am",
    "I didn\u2019t even think of initiation fees and dues and such. Entirely out of reach for young struggling artists.",
    "How much was her signing deal for? Because it's really hard for me to feel bad someone chose not to pay union dues and is upset they don't get the benefits of unionization.\n\n\n3000 is not an unusual deductible amount, and that is presumably a one time fee rather than annual..\n\n\nIt seems like we've just circles back to her maybe not understanding the landscape for the fact ESC is\u00a0 not only not the solutions, it's like 2/3 of the problem\u00a0",
    "There are actually two unions.  Vocalists are represented by SAG-AFTRA, instrumentalists by American Federation of Musicians (AFM).  Some artists are members of both.  SAG-AFTRA has better benefits.  Artists signed to major labels automatically become eligible for benefits.  This is not true for artists on indie labels.",
    "She's completely correct about Kamala Harris and the rest of the Dems, I don't think she made an idiotic argument at all.  You honestly just seem very mad.",
    "I don\u2019t think it is a good point, and it makes him look extra slimy, but these scum have never been in art to promote it with honesty or take care of artists.\n   As her star continues to rise and her platform\nDoes, she can continue to use her platform her tons of ways that aren\u2019t financial- I just wouldn\u2019t be surprised that a scumbag used this excuse.\n Again his point is \u201cI have always and will always be trash\u201d it doesn\u2019t make it right, I just don\u2019t think we can solely rely on these folks to change",
    "We don\u2019t know that she wasn\u2019t aware, either. What we do know is that she is *heavily* involved in curating all her looks. She works with her team rather than letting them work for her. So it\u2019s a very real possibility that she knew what was going on as well.",

    "You guys are quick to defend her EVERY move which is weird. I can be happy that she addressed healthcare for artists and support that while at the same time question why she is asking another artist for free work. Every artist should be treated fairly and should be paid for their work. At the end of the day, it\u2019s about that. People are quick to yell \u201cyou\u2019re tearing a woman down\u201d without understanding that it\u2019s a valid criticism of another human being. Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s a bad person but this is for sure easy to address",
    "Okay conspiracy theorist lol. And the person who sent the email is still on her team. The nail artist is obviously responding to her Grammy speech. It\u2019s cool that CR advocates for healthcare and treating artists fairly but she should also do the same. Obviously it\u2019s possible she wasn\u2019t aware of it but anything her team does is a reflection of her and it would\u2019ve been easy to address",
    "[deleted]",
    "Qualifying is not the same as joining. Qualifying means you\u2019re eligible to join, but you then still need to actually join.\n\nPerhaps you can negotiate with your label to include the fees in your contract? But I doubt a newly signed artist would have that kind of bargaining power.",
    "Also her parents live in Missouri. \u00a0She did move back with them for a while",
    "Yeah that happened to me. My parents dropped me at 19 because my dad\u2019s job refused to cover us at all so my dad would have had to pay out of pocket.",
    "Her mom is a veterinarian and her dad is an RN so I would imagine they could handle the cost tbh",
    "I think it's well intentioned but I think people need to recognize the details are everything. Just say \"healthcare is a human right\" or something vague about how keeping people locked out of healthcare is unacceptable.\u00a0\n\n\nESC works for middle to high earners really well. The higher up the income ladder you go, the better deal it becomes. The power you go, the shittier it gets. Right now theres this huge Medicaid gap where a lot of people are not able to get Medicaid, but cannot get an actual real fucking plan they can use, because the costs are astronomical.\u00a0\n\n\nTHAT is the core problem. Insurance works really good for rich people, we have a safety net for absolutely poverty, and we are fucking over the lower class workers. That precise segment is who the ESC primarily fails.\u00a0\n\n\nESC isnt the solutions. It's literally like 2/3 of the problem.\n\n\nAnd it espeically showed what a bad system is during the pandemic when we saw people getting laid off en masse and realized \"oh wow it's also just really stupid to tie these things together for other reasons as well\".\u00a0\n\n\nIt wouldn't help artist like Chappell. They are getting fucked over. They do lack basic security. But ESC is ...it's nothing in practice. It's cost inaccessible, it would increase the rate at which they get dropped, and they all still would have found themselves with no money and no prospects and no insurance in 2020. That's the problem. Is we keep doubling down on ESC like you can bootstrap your way out of insurability and it's just not true. Employers will never do it willingly. It makes the employees too expensive to offer good insurance, cause they're also getting shafted by insurance.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's a really complex tangled web of fucked upness and it's really important to emphasize over and over and over that ESC does not actually meaningfully help poor people. Most cannot actually see their doctor if they're insured at all. A huge chunk who are technically offered go without so they can buy luxuries like food and a car which gets them to their shitty job\u00a0",
    "you'd be surprised.  Chapelle was 5 years into her record contract in 2020...  she had sold essentially zero music (one, not popular ep).  She probably saw precisely zero income from Atlantic, after her advance, and despite rumors that they spend their advance on fancy cars and champaign, most artists do actually use their advance to pay their recording costs.",

    "She should have used the $3000 to join the union is my point. That should literally be the first thing you do. Unsigned artists hustle for studio time. I known this for a fact. And they'd jump for the chance to join a professional union.\u00a0\n\n\nIt just really seems like we keep circling around the same \"universal healthcare because ESC is stupid\". Where if you insist on an industry specific talking point, it's higher pay and the union. Not ESC.\u00a0\n\n\nShe wouldn't have been able to afford ESC if she can't afford union dues. Again, the union insurance is a lot better than a lot of ESC plans.\u00a0\n\n\nIf she's gonna keep delving into nuanced political issues, she should be ready for nuanced political pushback analysis. Otherwise just say \"fuck the industry, healthcare is a human right\". I am entirely fine with artists keeping it vague.\u00a0",

Part of fighting for minority rights would be doing something about Donald Trump and the other fascists, they had 4 whole years of justice department control and they didn't.  They didn't expand voting rights, they allowed Gaza to be bombed to nothing.  Why are we in here pretending like they don't set the tables for the fascists to eat at?",

    "You don't get those benefits unless you're working though, and by \"working\" they mean making money.   Someone further upthread said you had to make 27k yearly income as a recording artist to qualify for union insurance.\n\nI have a friend working in film, not quite the same, but similar.  You don't just \"get\" benefits - you have to work your ass off to make hours to qualify for the union, and if something happens to interrupt those hours/earnings qualifying you.... you get dropped.  So the union support is still mostly predicated on the stability of your career, it's not a safety net in the way you're thinking for many smaller artists.\n\nYou don't know if she paid into the union or not either, I'm guessing.\n\nIt's just frustrating when artists talk about problems in the art industry everyone is ready to come out and share that things are harder outside of the art world without acknowledging that all of this works in a very different way.  And tbh it ends up sounding like \"artists should just get real jobs\" a lot of the time.\n\nThere are ways to improve this - older seasoned artists with high income could pay more in dues, record labels could be required to pay into unions so artists could have more stable coverage, and in that way once you qualify you wouldn't be dropped as a newer or lower income artist when tines get rough.",
    "Dems aren\u2019t perfect and yes they are in bed with corporate interests just like the republicans. But there is a time and place to have that discussion. Not 1 month before a major presidential election. \n\nIt comes off as HYPOCRITICAL when you demonize one party for not doing something 100% the way you want when overall they support you, when the other party is literally openly saying they are going to remove your rights.",
    "Why wouldn\u2019t she just ask to be paid for them? She had a choice and she said no, which is fine, and everybody moved on. It doesn\u2019t seem weird to you that she would wait until 8 months later to come out and post the story online? For what, exposure?",
    "The chickens are just props for the liberal media!!!",
    "That's not what it says at all.\n\nIt literally just says it's sent by someone claiming (without proof) they're part of her team.\n\nYou're just making things up weirdly.",
    "I didn't say that. I said if she's gonna make a VERY specific demand which doubles down on the way healthcare is broke while public policy advocates are pushing in the exact opposite direction, then kind of need a coherent explanation\n\n\nDoes she think if she's bringing in no money they're gonna pay $500/month in her behalf? If she wants to be an employee, they're gonna fire her even sooner. That's just the reality of labor..if you're not bringing in money, if you're red in the books, they cut you. That IS every industry including the \"real\" jobs. I'm not putting art as lesser than real jobs. I'm questioning if Chappell has actually meaningfully thought about what she just asked for. Because it doesn't make sense to me\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like they just need higher pay. Probably like a union version of COBRA. I don't understand the thought process of ESC would have helped her\u00a0\n\n\nIf you can't afford the union dues, you can't afford ESC deductibles. If you arent bringing in enough to qualify for the union .....you're not making enough to qualify for your label paying your insurance premiums. It just seems like *at best* a lateral move, probably a net negative. And wasn't what she should have asked for.\u00a0\n\n\n(Which was more money and universal healthcare or like expanded Medicaid, getting the union to lower the threshold so there isn't a gap between Medicaid and insurance, etc)\n\n\n\n\nI just don't think artists should ask for very specific things unless they actually have thought through that specific thing. And considering how left she is and how exploitative she understands the industry is and the fact she was presumably in poverty ....I'm not understanding how she arrived as ESC\n\n\nThe entire problem is that healthcare tired to labor doesn't make sense, and Medicaid limits are way too fucking low so people cannot reasonably buy in. So there's a huge gap. It's *not* unique to her industry, and I think ESC seems really poor suited to the industry *because* they're not typical employees\u00a0",
    "I don't think you even know what hypocritical means",
    "Well, she simply shouldn\u2019t have had to ask to be paid for her work. It\u2019s a given. And no, it doesn\u2019t surprise me. Again, Chappell\u2019s fans can be ravenous. So I can understand attempting to move on and then seeing the person who essentially tried to obtain stuff from you for free, during the rise of her career, speaking up about paying artists would be triggering enough to make them come forward. Cause and effect.",
    "listen, i agree that we don't know whether the email is real or whether chappell even knew about it. \n\nthat being said. no person should \\*ask\\* to be paid for the work they do. they provide a service, the people who receive that service should automatically be ready to pay for it.",
    "it was proven via screen recording the email was real. ppl saying it was only brought up after the grammys for clout are deliberately ignoring the context. the nail tech only came forward after chappell went on stage and whined about how her label wasn\u2019t compensating her and other artists fairly. its extremely hypocritical for her and her fans to rally behind compensation for artists but then ignore and put down smaller artists when they ask for compensation from her.",
    "lol what!? Okay lol. There\u2019s actual video proof of it. Y\u2019all are just weird stans",
    "She's addressing a completely different kind of work than employment where you work for someone and are their outright employee.\n\nThe arts and artists really function on very different forms of employment and reimbursement and it's very difficult to compare if you haven't worked in that area, and that's why \"just get real employment\" = ends up sounding like just saying artists should just, like, not work in arts if they want better conditions.\n\nI don't just mean music, like theatre, fine arts, etc, all use employment and funding models that tend to stray from the \"x company employs me and I do what they say in exchange for y\", which makes complete sense if you think about the type of work done.  \n\nSaying just get a job that's a \"normal\" job - okay, but artists deserve to be able to ask for better working conditions as well, even if you don't understand how how that kind of work is often done or don't value it.  I've been an independent artist and I've been in STEM and it's foolish to think that arts don't matter and artists should just get \"real\" jobs if they want stability, art is essential to a healthy society.  And no, the US is not healthy right now, and I will always disagree with people who think asking for more and better is the problem.",

UFCW is pretty infamous for this.\u00a0 Usually through disengagement of membership -- either through high turnovers or encouraging a \"fuck you, got mine\" culture.\u00a0\n\n\nIt still becomes a question of artist led collective bargaining. The execs are comfortable being the bad guys and the fellow big name artist are let off the hook because it's not their fault, they're not the bad guys. The system festers like it has for decades.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat specifically does she even want? Label provided coverage wouldn't have addressed the gap she and many other artists faced. Does she want severance built into contracts? It harder to drop artists? Catastrophe insurance? Longer windows of non productivity if they get insurance through SAG? A union that actually meaningfully represents the fairly unique needs and aspects of the music industry (which are not reflective of the radio ecosystem from 80 years ago)?",

    "Didn\u2019t she say \u201c*I* felt used?\u201d It felt more like whining about how hard she had it becoming a world famous, pop star not about blue collar workers paying for treatment. And, once again, I\u2019ve been in the same boat as her. \n\nI\u2019ve paid for my health insurance because the pay I was getting made being an independent contractor more lucrative. I also had medications to take that cost an arm and leg out of pocket. \n\nBut I knew I\u2019d made my choice so I wasn\u2019t whining on social media about how I felt used by the construction company I worked for didn\u2019t pay me super high wages **and** free insurance. \n\nWhy is she held to different standard?",

The working people of the world aren\u2019t put her to subsidize fucking art majors with their tax money. \n\nDo you not see how this causes resentment among the unlucky Americans?

We\u2019re supposed to stay behind and be the runway for the *artists* of the world to take off on?  \n\nSomebody gotta scrub the toilets. \n\nAlso, I disagree.

The majority of Americans who make the hard but necessary choice to join the workforce and pay their taxes shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize free insurance for the people that just want to work in low paying, low benefit jobs like the arts. \n\nIt\u2019s the people who *choose* to work in that industry who bear the cost and responsibility for handling their healthcare.

    "The truth is, your amount of paid leave is also common in the US, but it's tied to your job and not the government. You can have a great job with great benefits, even unlimited paid/sick leave (Not that it works out to be a real benefit. Many people end up taking less time off if it's \"unlimited\"). \n\nBut there are also people who work just as hard in jobs that don't provide any benefits because they're contractors or have multiple part-time jobs. This inequality is built into the system when you make benefits contingent on employment.\n\n It also makes it harder to leave your job or even attempt to be an entrepreneur or artist.

I haven't needed to go to a doctor or use health services this year... it's not like I'm demanding the government give me my money back....  it goes into a healthcare budget which the goverment allocates to hospitals etc to help people who are sick and need those services now and then if in the future I need those services my care is covered from the same pot.",

Why does the record label deserve more than a nurse? \n\nNurses deserve way more pay but people who do work that creates lots of money will always earn more because that's the nature of money",
    "Yeah, and that's really shitty. It shouldn't depend on if you get a good boss or not.  A lot of places here offer extra leave too, including where I work.  But yeah that's the minimum required by law for a full time worker. \n\nWe have alot of contractors too but they are still covered by our health system. They need to make sure that what they're getting paid covers allowing for holidays, taxes, etc.  and contracting is predominately used by professionals in either trades or the govt. So big enough money, not a struggling musician. \n\nThe system in my country is by no means perfect but it certainly doesn't feel as rigged and warped as the American system (yet, the rot is spreading - we've got a dropkick coalition of chaos atm ourselves)",
