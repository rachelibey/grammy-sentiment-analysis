    "Ok now what about all the gay porn that people managed to somehow scrobble",
    "I talked a lot about the overall stats in [yesterday's thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/1irxvyy/the_popheads_charts_february_17th_2025_happy/mdc6msp/), so I won't repeat them here, but I will give you... MORE CHARTS!!\n\n## Most Total Points\n\n|#|Artist|Points\n|:--|:--|:--\n|1|Taylor Swift|56222\n|2|Charli XCX|34248\n|3|Ariana Grande|18159\n|4|Dua Lipa|14242\n|5|Carly Rae Jepsen|12792\n|6|Beyonc\u00e9|10008\n|7|Billie Eilish|9685\n|8|Olivia Rodrigo|9462\n|9|Kim Petras|8953\n|10|Lady Gaga|8503\n|11|Doja Cat|8100\n|12|Lana Del Rey|8090\n|13|Caroline Polachek|7754\n|14|Troye Sivan|7650\n|15|Lorde|7246\n|16|Sza|7192\n|17|The Weeknd|7005\n|18|Sabrina Carpenter|6464\n|19|Rina Sawayama|6229\n|20|Camila Cabello|5933\n|21|Chappell Roan|5485\n|22|Miley Cyrus|5328\n|23|Nicki Minaj|5072\n|24|Halsey|4942\n|25|Tove Lo|4731\n\n\nnow, of course this list is not too different from the chart of the artists with the most songs... which is where this next chart is particularly relevant!\n\n\n\n## Highest points per song (Total Points / Song Count)\n\n|#|Artist|Points|Songs|Points per song\n|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n|1|Chappell Roan|5485|10|548.5\n|2|Jay Park|535|1|535\n|3|Beam|423|1|423\n|4|Rufus Wainwright|393|1|393\n|5|Portugal.

Also congratulations to Jay Park for having the honour of recieving the most points with only 1 charting song ~~despite most people hating your part of the song~~\n\n---\n\nI want to give a special shoutout to the songs that received exactly one total point. This means that they placed exactly at #50, in exactly one weekly chart, and never appeared again. Since the chart only started in 2017, there are some particularly funny entries to see here. \n\nThere are also 15 unlucky artists who have only appeared ONCE in the entire charts history, and barely scraped a placement at #50.

    "Amazing how many of the top 100 are from 2024 despite having the least amount of time to chart! I can only presume the sub's growth has something to do with it.\n\nAlso stoked to see American Teenager here",
    "i love that this is mostly female presenting in the tops spots",
    "Good Luck, Babe! doing that in less than a year \u2728",
    "My lord Chappell!",
    "The only charts I care about are popheads charts, let's goooo. Justice for our girl CRJ tho \ud83d\ude1e",
    "good luck babe the classic that you are!",
    "Can someone give me some Kylie Minogue stats for this? Like has she had a song chart here and if so, does it rank anywhere on the top 100 chart?",
    "okay everyone we just need to keep streaming good luck babe for 63 more weeks we can do it y'all",
    "> Meek Mill\n\nI have to wonder if this Dreams and Nightmares pop up has anything to do with the Philadelphia Eagles and their Super Bowl win in 2018. That was their hype song for the post season, ran out to it at the Super Bowl and was pretty synonymous with the team that year.\n\nI can\u2019t think of any other bump but we\u2019ve been doing this for 400 weeks so who knows!",
    "Justice for Ecco2k",
    "I went to go check just for you, Padam Padam is Kylie's highest song at #109 with 612 points. Tension is the next closest all the way down at #453 with 273 points.",
    "This flop ho, all my Padam payola and not even a top 100 placement.",
    "1 Taylor Swift\n\n2 Drake\n\n3 SEVENTEEN\n\n4 Billie Eilish\n\n5 Stray Kids\n\n6 Zach Bryan\n\n7 The Weeknd\n\n8 Eminem\n\n9 Kendrick Lamar\n\n10 Sabrina Carpenter",
    "I didn't expect to see Zach Bryan on the list. With the likelihood of no new album and only re-releases this year, I wonder if Taylor can secure the #1 spot next year. Since BTS is coming back soon and Drake dropped a new album, I feel like the competition will be good!",
    "I have never heard of seventeen or stray kids. Are they k pop??",
    "TTPD being her first #1 on the global album sales chart is crazy omg \ud83d\ude2d she's finally beaten the #2 curse after like 5 of her albums getting 'stuck' there, I think releasing it in the first 6 months of the year was what made it happen",
    "The Torture poets departament achieves an all kill in IFPI global charts:\n\n1.Streaming Albums\n\n1.Pure Sales albums (5.6 M pure sales)\n\n1.Vinyl Sales Albums (2.2 M vinyl)\n\nTaylor achieves multiple entries in global streaming chart (#1 TTPD, #7 Lover, #12 Midnights #16 1989 TV) and Vinyl sales album chart (#1 TTPD, #5 1989 TV, #6 Midnights #7 folklore #9 lover #11 Evermore).",
    "There was just a thread created yesterday saying Taylor\u2019s music is consumed by only white girls. Haha\nThe Tortured poets department opened with 100M streams in China alone in one week.\nAlso, Taylor Swift was the only female as well as non Chinese artist in top 10 of China last year and she was 2nd.\nAnd as an international fan of Taylor, I think USA is actually the only place where she has competition cause globally, those in USA with cultural impacts or GP lovers are all khia\u2019s \nIndian guy here.",
    "Taylor, even without smash single from TTPD, 18m units in the US alone, no one comes close.",
    "and haters still say only Taylor's fan listen to her. NO, Swifties only can't achieve #1 on GLOBAL, STREAMING, SALES and VINYL all at once. this proves the gp LISTENS to Taylor Swift.",
    "Congrats to Taylor!",
    "Well, thank God it\u2019s her and not Drake.",
    "Surprisingly, not many kpop acts this year. Last year the top 10 of the sales chart was entirely kpop (with the exception of Taylor Swift). I wonder whether the sales dropped or the calculation methodology changed?",
    "\\*slow clap\\*",
    "[removed]",
    "Kpop boy groups sales go crazy",
    "Drake at #2 is insane",
    "Not too surprising a list but I would\u2019ve assumed Beyonc\u00e9 would at least crack the top 10, *Cowboy Carter* had a big debut but I guess not much staying power.",
    "Oh wow Zach Bryan is on the top 10 list",
    "I think if rep and debut both get released this year, and specially if reputation delivers on the unfathomable level of hype, plus the steam The anthology still has left in the tank, she can get it.\n\nHowever BTS has a ton of potential with their comeback if the music hits with the gp like dynamite/butter, it's gonna be absolutely massive. I feel like all of them got bigger with their solo releases so the potential as group is higher than before the break.",
    "I'm pretty sure she will release a new album this year and i think it will be before the re-recordings",
    "I'm pretty sure she will release a new album this year and i think it will be before the re-recordings",
    "If anyone from the country genre was going to make the list I thought it would\u2019ve been Morgan Wallen. I think Taylor gets it next year as well. With Taylor it\u2019s irrelevant if it\u2019s re-records, Rep TV is going to be huge, and Debut TV will do well and I think she may put another album out near the end of the year now that Eras has wrapped and she has the time. There\u2019s lot of good artists currently so who knows, but it\u2019ll be entertaining.",
    "Yes, they are both kpop groups.",
    "In 2023 they were 2nd and 3rd on that same chart, so they've gone down a bit compared to the previous year (not a mystery as to why, their physical album sales have gone down pretty significantly compared to the previous year).",
    "That only happened because she always released late in the year like October or November, so her new project was only accumulating sales for 2 months compared to the 5 or 6 months that other projects had\u00a0",
    "and you'd still hear bullshit about torchie being only heard in people's echo chamber when it's both streaming and selling well",
    "Taylor's legendary status is assured. She is already in the same league with Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis, Madonna.",
    "Wait, TTPD topped album sales, not Seventeen? Or that 5.6 from TTPD alone? Based on BB or luminate she sold 6M pure in US alone for the whole catalogs.",
    "Lol this reminds me of an American i saw on tiktok. They were upset that on rednote none of the Chinese people they were talking too cared about kpop music, they only wanted to talk about taylor \ud83d\ude02 not sure why they thought Chinese people would be big kpop stans, they must have gotten lost on Google maps.",
    "Actually, Taylor has serious local competition in most music markets, but she's one of the very few artists to be successful almost everywhere.",
    "I hope her next project will be more radio friendly aka real pop bangers like 1989 or Red.",
    "[deleted]",
    "Kpop saw a decline in album sales last year. ([Source](https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-12-31/business/industry/Kpop-physical-album-sales-bubble-bursts-to-fall-19/2211881)).",
    "I think you might be misremembering, there were four kpop artists in 2023's top ten. There are two that have dropped out, NewJeans and TXT. NewJeans are currently embroiled in legal issues with their company which might explain why they aren't in the top ten this year. TXT I don't know well enough to comment on why that might be.",
    "Let's not exaggerate too much, There were four kpop acts last year in the top 10 (Seventeen, Stray Kids, TXT, NewJeans). The chart that's trusted by kpop is the one for physical sales, whereas the global artist chart takes streaming into account, which means kpop acts need a lot more sales to take spots from Western artists.\n\nKpop album sales did decline a bit compared to 2023, which has led to Seventeen and Stray Kids to  go down a bit, and TXT to fall out of the top 10. (NewJeans only released a few singles, and lost a lot of their momentum, so they're likely much more far down for 2024).",
    "[deleted]",
    "Agree! I dont know anyone who listens to him so his achievements always come as a surprise to me somehow. But then again, I\u2019ve heard some comments from others about almost all pther artists on this list so I guess crowds are different :D",
    "When you consider drake is a pop star and not a rapper it makes sense",
    "Cowboy Carter is #18 on the albums chart so it's not too surprising. Beyonce made the top 20 at #18 too. This is the rest of the list btw:\n\n11 Ariana Grande\n\n12 Post Malone\n\n13 Morgan Wallen\n\n14 ENHYPEN\n\n15 Travis Scott\n\n16 Kanye West\n\n17 Lana Del Rey\n\n18 Beyonc\u00e9\n\n19 Linkin Park\n\n20 Bad Bunny\n\nI am surprised that Bad Bunny is \"this low\".",
    "It wasn\u2019t as big as it was made to be. It only sat at number 1 on Billboard for 2 weeks and sold only around half a million copies. Taylor had 17 weeks at number quandary sold 6.2 million copies. Taylor outsold and out streamed the 5 artists behind her combined according to the IFPI data.",
    "Yeah, BTS' return is highly anticipated. Kpop album sales are expected to increase because of their return. It depends what they have in store! I know they're releasing a 10 year anniversary project, but no clue if there's going to be an album later this year or next. However, there's still a lot of excitement for Reputation TV and that excitement could possibly help Taylor keep that top spot.",
    "She tends to follow a two year schedule. She's basically been doing this since the start of her career. The biggest gap was between 1989 and Reputation (3 years); however, since then she returned to basically releasing a new album every two years (Midnights in 2022 and TTPD last year). So, I'm expecting Debut and Rep TV this year and new album next year.",
    "Seventeen sold 3.4M and they were 2nd.\nFunny thing is, nobody from US like Billie or Sabrina was even in top 20.",
    "The expectation of them being kpop stans is likely because a pretty big chunk of kpop album sales is due to Chinese stans mass buying them.",
    "That\u2019s what I was trying to say that overall, she leads.\nLike in terms of Vinyl sales, there wasn\u2019t any Asian in top 15.\nAnd in terms of album units sales, there wasn\u2019t any non Asian in top 20 except Taylor.\nShe is an all rounder.\nAnd I hate it so much how people say she is local. Like I would like to see ur favs be all rounder like her.",
    "I feel like there was so much single potential on TTPD but she insists on picking the worst single choices every damn time \ud83e\udd72",
    "The of means Taylor overall, she sold 18 M in US in 2024 confirmed by Billboard, second biggest year ever after her own 2023 with 18.5 M",
    "My bad, i mean 18m for her whole catalogue in the US.",
    "Very interesting, but i disagree about the HYBE/ador dispute being a factor, i think it only really affected newjeans. \n\nBut it's right about 2025 being a indicator as bts is undoubtedly the juggernaut of kpop, and blackpink has a lot of demand after their hiatus and solos. (Then again, it's very hard to say if this affects other groups)",
    "I think even without the dispute, there still would've been less Kpop acts within the top ten. NewJeans' Japan debut underperformed. It looks like TxT had two comebacks, but I think general fatigue led to sales decline. I think Kpop will rise again with the return of BTS. I dunno if BlackPink is releasing a new album, but their return should also help.",
    "My bad, i was in fact thinking about the sales chart, i will edit it",
    "It's weird to see people act like Drake isn't huge because he is at a (deserved) low right now. Drake pulls in massive numbers.",
    "Most artist most streamed music are the old catalog classic albums/songs not the new shxt",
    "Wikipedia article is very outdated. Drake comes in second, Taylor is over 200M in sales and Drake has 170M, Taylor hasn\u2019t bothered updating her certifications in 4 years, I\u2019d she did she\u2019d be at 20+ diamond certifications. Taylor is also ahead of Drake in total streams by roughly 1 billion streams. Drake still doing way better than everyone else though, Kendrick\\`s metrics are not even on Drake\\`s radar, just like Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s are not near Taylor\u2019s. That\u2019s why the Grammys can no longer be respected. They purposely awarded Bey and Kendrick this year to try and bring the top 2 artists of at least the last 15 years down a peg.",
    "Can't he be both?",
    "Damn Kanye was more popular than Beyonc\u00e9 in 2024? That might be the most shocking part of this list.",
    "Bad Bunny being that low is a complete joke. It\u2019s pretty much entirely because his biggest audience is Spanish speakers. \n\nWhich is ironic because, as a white Scottish person, he\u2019s even big here.",
    "That doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t big, just means Taylor was monumentally bigger. Like *TTPD* was breaking sales records left and right so that can\u2019t be the barometer of success.",
    "Im really curious to see what BTS comes back with tbh. Especially with each members solos being pretty different sonically I wonder what its going to sound like. I am not so familiar with their album creation process except for RM is heavily involved so I wonder if it means it\u2019s already been written pre - enlistment or in progress at the moment . I feel like if an album comes it will be more like fall 2025 but I could be wrong . Also super interested to see what their eventual tour is going to look like apart from massive.",
    "I think Rep TV has the potential for a much wider audience this time after the Eras tour. She\u2019s massively more popular than she was in 2017 when Rep originally came out and she was had just returned from her self imposed exile and the failed cancellation. Rep TV is going to do big numbers.",
    "Well to me all signs are leading to a new album but we will see \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "One thing you need to know about Taylor is to not follow patterns. Now is pretty obvious that TS12 is coming before the last two tvs",
    "After hours is not at all in top 20. You may mistaken with Golden Hour by Ateez.",
    "Very few Asian artists ever release vinyls tbh. Probably because of the delay to get them pressed, it doesn't fit with the faster pace of local industries.",
    "At least Taylor previously picked the right song as the first single (Anti-Hero). If you think about it, Taylor didn't promote TTPD as much as she could. Barely any TV appearances (if any), barely any interviews, no late night show performances, one music video, only 2 singles, etc.",
    "I agree, I don't think the HYBE vs. MHJ dispute really caused that much of an issue with Kpop as a whole. I know I'm an ARMY so maybe my opinion is biased, but I honestly think the lack of BTS is really what caused the sales to decline.",
    "BlackPink is supposedly releasing new music as a group this year! Personally cannot wait. But yes, heavyweights coming back, I'm so intrigued to see where BTS will be on this list next year.",
    "Not in the case of Taylor or Drake though, their new stuff outsells/out streams everyone else as well as their old catalogue. Tortured poets outsold and out streamed the 5 artists behind her combined in the IFPI global data.",
    "Didn't he have the most streamed rap album for 2024 with a 2023 album?",
    "I think Kendrick and Beyonce just made really good music this year. It's not a conspiracy. There's certainly industry politics but it's not like there's a movement to bring down Taylor or Drake. (Well, people definitely hate Drake right now but unless proof of the rumored crimes materializes it's not going to go anywhere)",
    "Beyonce\u2019s catalogue is inexistent, Numbers are terrible right and left. It\u2019s weird because songs like single ladies do very low numbers.",
    "Keeping her first streaming-era album off of streaming for years was a huge loss. Songs from Lemonade would\u2019ve been on playlists and being replayed to this date, but she torpedoed its longevity by restricting it for so long. It still gets significantly less streams per day than every other album of hers",
    "Bad bunny did pretty well considering he didn't release an album in 2024, but he's off to an excellent start this year",
    "Well it actually does, artists make music for public and fan consumption. The streaming and sales of TTPD indicates millions of people wanted to listen to it which is the ultimate success. The records and awards are only a byproduct of that success. The metrics of Cowboy Carter indicate it was not hugely consumed by her fan base or the general public regardless of the massive media push for it, hype and radio airplay. Beyonc\u00e9 made this album to prove a point but ultimately it was not what her fan base liked, Taylor is primarily a storyteller and lyricist focusing on her life experiences and that\u2019s what TTPD gave the fans.",
    "I'm super curious and excited about what they'll come back with! I kinda hope it's more like Run BTS and less like Dynamite (no offense to dynamite since I really enjoyed that song). There is a 10-year HYYH anniversary project that is coming out sometime this year. I imagine it'll be like Proof with a few new songs and demos. \n\nAs far as their involvement, all the members are involved but the rap line I would say are the most involved with the album creation process. So I'm expecting a lot of involvement from the three of them again.",
    "I just made this comment, but this schedule is what is leading me to believe that the re-records are this year with a new album next year:\n\n* 2021 = Fearless and Red TV\n* 2022 = Midnights\n* 2023 = Speak Now and 1989 TV\n* 2024 = TTPD\n\nAgain, I could be wrong but I think it's very fair to think she'll follow this schedule -- especially if she wants to take this year easier following the end of the eras tour and as she preps to direct the film she wrote.",
    "Teach me your ways... What are the signs?",
    "I personally don't think TS12 is coming before the re-records. She's been on a consistent pattern within the last few years. \n\n* 2021 = Fearless and Red TV\n* 2022 = Midnights\n* 2023 = Speak Now and 1989 TV\n* 2024 = TTPD\n\nSo, I feel like it's fair to assume that Rep and Debut will be out this year and a new album next year. Of course things can change, but I'm inclined to believe she's following this schedule.",
    "I don\u2019t know what ur talking about. When did I say After Hours.\n:/",
    "Maybe. But again, even in streams, western leads where Taylor clears again. So, Taylor is an all rounder despite\nWest: streams, vinyls\nEast: album units",
    "She was this close \ud83e\udd0f to burning from overexposure last year(s), with the eras tour success, the breakup, matty healy drama, dating Travis, winning AOTY for Midnights, the NFL appearances, the stan wars with Billie's/Charli's/Chapell's fans, the criticism for flying so much, endorsing Kamala in the elections, etc. Taylor was everywhere. I'm not surprised she didn't see the need to promote TTPD, or maybe outright avoided it.",
    "Their music is not for me (I tried) but I think their return will be huge - especially with Ros\u00e9's collaboration with Bruno. It might've brought new fans? \n\nI am really excited for BTS' return! There's a 10-year anniversary project for HYYH coming out this year (hopefully in April) and they might kick off a tour at the end of the year. It'll be an exciting year!",
    "That was future we don\u2019t trust you if you look at his highest charting album right now it\u2019s \u2019take care\u2019",
    "That\u2019s crazy to me, in my mind she always had one of the strongest back catalogues for both singles and albums.",
    "I\u2019m not questioning the success of *TTPD* I\u2019m just saying that since it\u2019s the most successful album of the year it\u2019s not obviously not the standard.",
    "I would be very surprised if their comeback is anything like Dynamite/Butter/Permission to Dance! Yet to Come/Run BTS/For Youth is very in-line sound-wise with the rest of their discography and the English trio songs are kind of their own thing.\n\nI'm personally hoping for a *BE* level of involvement from the members, that is involved on every level, not just the lyrics/production but the MV, etc. \ud83d\udc40",
    "You will see \ud83d\ude42",
    "I was just commenting on Asian artists' absence on the Vinyl chart, not questioning Taylor's dominance.",
    "BTS aren't my cup of tea (although Mic Drop is a banger I'll never stop listening to) but I will for sure be tuning in for their return. And happy for their fans after their long wait! Gonna need tips for when my faves start their military service. :(",
    "Maybe I am wrong, but I thought for all the dogs was highest streamed rap album and in the top 5/10 for all genres",
    "The English trio really had a positive response from the GP. So I can see a scenario where they maybe one more English radio friendly song when they comeback. But hopefully I'm wrong. \n\n>I'm personally hoping for a\u00a0*BE*\u00a0level of involvement from the members, that is involved on every level, not just the lyrics/production but the MV, etc.\n\nThis would be cool! I would honestly love to see JK design an album cover, Jin to handle merch/promotional ideas, Tae create concepts for videos, and etc.",
    "I\u2019m on your side hopeful-pickle! I think she\u2019s saving the TVs for a rainy day. I think ts12 comes in May soonest.\u00a0",
    "Who are your faves? Ugh, military enlistment sucks so much. Although, I'll say that it wasn't so bad with BTS because they had so many solo releases that it made time flyby. And the members periodically came online which was really nice. I think BTS handled their enlistment exceptionally well and more Kpop agencies might follow what BigHit did which should hopefully be reassuring. \n\nIt's still sucks though and it's sad. So, don't feel embarrassed about feeling sad or emotional when your faves do enlist.",
    ">So I can see a scenario where they maybe one more English radio friendly song when they comeback.\n\nHonestly I got the impression they're kind of over chasing that specific kind of success - maybe I'm just projecting or reading too into it, but yeah. I'm not too worried since there would still be the B-sides, etc.\n\n>JK design an album cover, Jin to handle merch/promotional ideas, Tae create concepts for videos\n\nYour words to Big Hit's ears lmao, I would go crazy if that happened!",
    "I agree that, from what I saw, their enlistment period has been handled very well and I hope to see other companies follow suit!\n\nStray Kids for me. A little different because they have two Aussies who don't have to serve and I'm excited to see what the two of them end up doing while the others are away. But the closer it gets the more I'm dreading how it won't be the same for a while. \n\nThanks for your nice comment!",
    "Is SKZ going to start their enlistment after their tour this year? Well, the two Australian members will definitely fill the void with solo projects. The group will also probably latter their enlistment, like what BTS did, so there might be other solo projects or subgroup projects as the members go. And again the members can post online! It just depends on their personal choice. Like, Suga opted to not post since he's doing social service. JungKook shook the fandom when he did a WeVerse live last year. Jin posted on social media once a month, but he also pre-recorded some videos for fans. So, it won't be totally silent from SKZ! It'll just be different.",
    "The oldest non-Aussie is 27 this year so it's coming. The tour is part of why I'm thinking about it already because I wonder, after being spoiled by years of multiple releases, how much group music we'll get while they're on tour and then I do expect them to start enlisting next year.\n\nI guess not hearing from them made when they are able to interact that much more exciting and special.",

The Chainsmokers hold nearly a third of the top 10 most controversial as #SELFIE joins Closer [AS4 - #3] and Closer [2016 EP Rate - #9].\n* **Think U The Shit** also joins #SELFIE as it becomes the 41st most controversial song we've rated. The two new additions knock two 2009 classics off the list: Kesha - Dinosaur and Owl City - Fireflies\n* **#SELFIE** also gets on the list for 'most 0'd songs' as 14 is the cutoff (which it got). It sits in a tie for 41st with numerous other tracks including fellow All Stars honouree stupid horse (AS4)\n* This is our 5th time rating **Taylor Swift - Blank Space**, tieing it as one of our many 3rd most rated songs. Other 5 timers include California Gurls, Call Me Maybe, Rather Be, Shake It Off, Tik Tok, and Viva La Vida\n* A few other songs get their 4th appearance this rate including **Disturbia**, **Latch**, **2 On**, **Sunflower**, and **Diva** (in descending order of their average score across each of their appearances)\n\n#**Artists**\n\nI'm working on limited hardware at 2 in the morning so I very much considered not doing this section, but it's not an All Stars without a focus on the stars\n\n**Artist Shifts**\n\nPossibly a first for an All Stars rate we actually don't have any new additions to the leaderboard - only shifts!

And to think a year ago today we were still making 'Stevie Wonder no rate win' jokes\n* **Stevie** also manages to swap spots with Jessie Ware and takes a spot in the top 10 highest rated artists on the sub at #10!\n* We also have another swap further down the list as **OutKast** take the boundary spot at #50 from **Tina Turner**, whose drop of only a few points wasn't enough to keep her in the top 50. \t\n* Though there's a bit of movement at the bottom of the chart, **Post Malone** finally manages to scavenge up enough points to escape the bottom 50 rated artists on the sub! He's at 52 so while he's not out of the clear yet, it's a start at a new life. Joining the bottom 50 in his place is none other than fellow AS8 artist **Ice Spice**, whose appearance in the rate dropped her over 40 places into the 49th lowest average score on the sub\n* **Ice Spice** also gets an appearance on the most controversial artists list as she ends up as our 9th highest average artist controversy. The Chainsmokers hold 1st for this stat and their appearance here only helps extend their lead \n* Thanks to a single lone 11, **Hall & Oates** manage to escape the no 11's list with their very first 11 this rate. Though their names will be noted on the historic list for shameful perpetuity, at least they don't have an active streak going\n* **GloRilla** and **ScHoolboy Q** manage to both hold onto their no 0's streak for another song. We'll see if that lasts into Cali Rap in April\n* **Beyonc\u00e9** joins **The Weeknd** in the top spot for most rate appearances as she picks up her 29th here to tie him. Rihanna, Taylor, and Ariana follow in 3rd with 27 each\n* There's no major shifts on the most artist 11's leaderboard, but we did hit a milestone as **Taylor Swift** picked up her 500th 11 this rate!\n* There is something for the most artist 0s chart however, as The Chainsmokers get enough to become the 10th most 0'd artist on the sub. They are the only artist in the top 10 with fewer than 80 songs rated (they have 17). Their 0s/per song rate is 6.059 where the next highest in the top 10 is only 2.534 (Taylor Swift)\n\n#**Rate**\n\n* With 74.19% of the rate getting at least someone's 11, **AS8** becomes the rate with the 17th highest 11 spread across songs! Other fellow All Stars rates are also on this list include AS1 [12th] and AS4 [25th]\n* With an even 82% of the participants handing out a 0, **All Stars 8** becomes the rate with the 15th highest 0 usage on the sub! AS6 [10th - 84.31%] and AS4 [25th - 78.91%] are also on this list",
    "# SONGENIALITY RESULTS\n\nMany were taken aback by the cruelty of the day 1 and 2 results, so we asked you **which songs were most robbed** to settle it once and for all.\n\nWe received 71 votes!\n\n\ud83e\udd47 In first place, with 17 votes, was **Rainbow Connection**\n\n\n\ud83e\udd48 In second place, with 11 votes each, were **Wanna Be** and **Piano Man**\n\n\ud83e\udd49 In third place, with 9 votes each, was a 4-way tie between **Lazerpop, Blank Space, Latch**, and **212**\n\n\n\ud83d\ude34 Only four songs did not receive votes: **Find Your Way Back**, **'Cross The Room**, **34+35**, and **Think U The Shit (Fart)**\n\n\n# RATE VILLAIN\n\n\nWe also asked you to vote for the **rate villain**, the song that least deserved to be in day 3. 66 people weighed in. 14 votes decreed this as **HOT TO GO!** This was despite Chappell receiving the highest number of artist votes (and the second highest number of overall votes for this song) during the wildcard process.\n\nIn second place, with 7 votes, was **It's A Sin**.\n\n# WORST DAY\n\n66 voters responded to our question on which day was worse, and 63% of you decreed that **day 2 was worse**. \n\n# LOTR SHOWDOWN\n\nFinally, your favourite LoTR character was a fierce fight, but **Gandalf** narrowly won out with 18% of the 61 responses. 16.4% voted for Gollum, and 11.5% for Aragorn. Other notable responses included 'the Black Eyed Peas' (raising questions about how much more Fergalicious the Fellowship could have been), Eowyn (who I should definitely have included in the original poll), and 'I don't do that nerd shit' (host note: this user plays Fire Emblem). \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThanks for joining us!

I think where this falls short is its meaning - it makes all these vague allusions to the ocean and some kind of storyline, but doesn't really take them anywhere. I've read a tonne of lyrical exegesis speculating on everything from Greek myth to the ego to climate change and none of them really hit for me. This is a pretty track, but one sort of weirdly devoid of a soul (?)\n\n**beeozan** (0): I wrote a bunch about not liking this album at all when indieheads rated it for their ult and it's grown off me even more since. i don't care if she's screeching if the verses have no energy and then the chorus is all anthemic fluff without any kind of \"earned\" buildup to it. those \"hey hey hey\"s are incredibly phoned in. the guitar riff in the chorus sounds so limp and the eventual solo is lame. i'm glad i'm not alone in the 0s section at least\n\n---\n\n## Host comment\n\n**RandomHypnotica** (10): music video so skinny it scares me\n\n## DESIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE\n\n**asadprofessorplum** (11): I\u2019m really living it, laughing it, loving it, doing it, completing it, owning it, sucking it, fucking it, throwing it up, shitting on it. I feel like a winner.\n\n**camerinian** (11): the more that time passes, the more that i realise this might be a perfect song, and every time I think about this song I cannot help but marvel at how perfect it is. Caroline\u2019s vocal runs are jaw-dropping, every melodic line is constructed with the most euphoric release in mind, the entire structure of the song is perfect in how it builds itself up with this glamorous, above-it-all self-image, only to drive a stake through it on the bridge where all the deflection disappears in a cloud of doubt and guilt, the instrumentation that is dreamy and dense at the same time, like it's just so surgically precise with hitting the pleasure centres that all this writing has to be done post-listen because the only words in mind when it's playing are \u201ccunt yass mother\u201d\n\n**mustwinfullgaming** (11): like what an iconic introduction to the album...her vocals really did that\n\n**NFLfreak98** (11): ugh her voice is truly otherworldly\n\n**1998tweety** (10): me when my friends would come to my animal crossing town during the pandemic\n\n**Awkward\\_King** (10): all the little greek mythology tidbits referenced throughout the album (and videos) is so cool i love a motif bitch\n\n**bigbigbee** (10): I saw Caroline Polachek wear army pants and flip flops a big bow in her hair. so I bought army pants and flip flops a big bow for my hair.\n\n**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now more than ever\u2026.EXTENDED SCREECHING\n\n**buildingigloos** (10): Her yodeling at the start of the song feels like home to me, the Charli remix was my most played song of 2023, and the original placed high as well.\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (10): I adore this song and this album.

'but han, those baby sounds are annoyin-' shut up. this is avant-garde chic. if you get it you get it. love how Timbaland's verse adds a lil sonic break to this, too - it's so well-paced, and incredibly emblematic of the era.

The Boy Is Mine is a pretty standard R&B ballad that I\u2019ve never really got the huge praise for and Are You That Somebody is the forward thinking masterpiece that represented one of the genre\u2019s true greats operating at her absolute peak (and Timbaland\u2019s there for some reason). Brandy and Monica are also great, believe me, but nothing off either their albums can compare to the flash of truly unique, awe-inspiring, incredible pop music genius that is this song. One of the best songs EVER and if I\u2019d known it would be this robbed I would have 11d it the first time around\n\n**ConnerY2323** (10): aaliyah x timbaland one of the all time most fruitful collaborations and i try not to think too hard\n\n**FitzMarble** (10): \u201cWhile creating the beat for \"Are You That Somebody?\", Timbaland was inspired by the \u2018Oompa Loompa\u2019 song from the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film (1971).\u201d\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i mean it\u2019s her signature hit for a reason!\n\n**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/LSKXDKq.png\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (10): y\u2019know I always forget that Timbaland is one of the most important dudes in the 90\u2019s\n\n**Nagisoid** (10): The Baby Queen acclaim was in the room...\n\n**Roxieloxie** (10): timeless bop\n\n**Runaway3212** (10): a legend\n\n**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): people make ripoffs of the boy is mine all the time but no one has ever tried to make a ripoff of this. that is because this song is untouchably perfect and everybody knows it\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): how does this get left off the album but put on the annabelle soundtrack? it can be a ten now for it truly feeling like its all alone in this tuff rate\n\n**Ayzrules** (9.2): loving this beat\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (9): Timbaland, what were u cookin'?\n\n**WindysaStarStarStar** (9): idk read my FLO write up on why I like this\n\n**RandomHypnotica** (8): i cannot hear this song without thinking of that AOC edit\n\n**vayyiqra** (8): Timbaland was the Dem Jointz of the 2000s.

As such, this sort of swinging vaguely funky bassline was definitely not what I expected - it feels like they have diversified their sound, but I'm still not sure if it's in a direction I love. I did quite enjoy the gospel-choir-esque outro, but I think I was hoping for more of that raw energy from their original albums.\n\n---\n\n## living in the real world\n\n**bogo** (11): consider this an apology for submitting festival pop rock\n\n**buildingigloos** (11): When this song first came out I enjoyed it but didn't get it. Now I'm an adult, it really hits hard. The production of this song is so good, the choir and bassline at the end is top tier. I love when they perform live and Hayley just destroys it at the end. The live version of this just really showcases Hayleys range, she's an amazing singer and it annoys me that she's often missed off the greatest singers lists. When I saw them on Eras tour, the girls sat behind me talked all the way through the acapella outro and ruined my video. Also does anyone else remember the 1st MV they shot for this?

I couldn't understand what she was saying in the lyrics so to make it less frightening I kinda made up my own silly lyrics and the tail end of the pre-chorus (right before she starts saying \"Disturbia\") I pretended she was saying \"Michael Wazowski is hot,\" and so now whenever I hear the song I just think about Rihanna trying to have sex with that little green cyclops from *Monsters Inc.*. That's also why I don't like the song \"S&M,\" it makes me think about Rihanna pooping in someone's car. And also honestly I just don't really like how a lot of early Rihanna singles sound, but I guess that's beside the point.",

    "I used to listen to Ladies of the Canyon, the album it's on, all the time as a kid, where I didn't really ever register any of the titles. Then I lost the CD and also forgot the title of the album for the longest time. When streaming started popping up I tried to find this song. I looked through her albums and mused that it was probably on this one, but I couldn't find any title that I felt feasibly could be this song. So I went through her discography trying to find a song whose title seem to fit the song, I remembered. Ultimately, I started wondering if the song even existed. Then one day, in like 2014-2015, I put on a playlist of 70s music and all of the sudden, there it was. I was shocked that this title I had seen so many times, thinking it possible couldn't be my song was actually it. Terrible title and it kept me away from a wonderful song for nearly a decade.",
    "that\u2019s my thing, why not all of them ?",
    "I'm confused if everyday is wrong or not. when I search the word itself on Google, it comes out as \"Everyday\" not every day",

    "I mean it's obviously sarcastic. But I agree it's still lame. You don't have to forget, you don't have to forgive, but you do have to let me live without ever hearing a song about fucking Kim Kardashian ever again in my life, please and thank you, miss Taylor.",
    "Also the entire point of the song is that it's a diss track but she doesn't want to name who the person is....so why would she undermine that by making it obvious",
    "The fact the lyrics of this song specifically make a big deal about \u201cI\u2019m not even gonna name you\u201d \u2013 the name just being in the title is *such* a hack move.",
    "I would have liked the song more without the capitalization. I can relate to the whole \u201cbeing picked on by the mean girl in school\u201d thing. I can\u2019t relate to the \u201cbeefing with Kim Kardashian\u201d thing.",
    "It's explained in the lyrics",
    "[deleted]",
    "I think it could have been better executed with like '... of my life', or even 'legendary', playing into the double meaning of that word.\n\nFrom a purely lyrical point of view, I legitimately feel like it is one of the most well executed songs on the album. It's wordy, but not messy or meandering, and actually fits the rhythm of the song quite well, with some pretty banger lyrics. But ultimately, I just find myself never taking it seriously because of that damn title makes it seem so silly. I could probably live with either the title or the mental image of Matty Healy, but I can't possibly do both.",
    "What? i've never heard of this. lol hilarious",
    "Oh was it? I see. Everytime I heard the well known version on TV they\u2019d put Christmas for the brokenhearted next too it, I\u2019ll blame the TV ahha",
    "I know but it\u2019s such a short title and with is the longest word in it. I get why but it just looks so odd",
    "Why not just call it Promise then?",
    "I mean, she's not Suzy Dent, and this album has quite a few instances of clunky songwriting. I do think it's likely she didn't know down bad could mean something other than sad. Either that or she really is horny and crying at the gym.",

    "oh, i see. it depends on the context and subject. Thanks for clarifying",
    "I think mentioning Kim's child who is, you know, a *child,* in the same song as she talks about her mother wishing Kim was dead is incredibly tactless and cruel. The bratty title is icing on the cake.",
    "That's why a lot of publishers and style guides have adopted a workaround by limiting lowercase prepositions to 3 letters or less, because it was getting harder (and uglier) to decide whether four-letter prepositions like \"like,\" \"past,\" \"upon\" should remain lowercase, leading to ugly titles like these:\n\n* Four past Midnight\n* Someone like You\n* A City upon a Star\n\nI hated this when I used to maintain a website.

Contain multitudes, etc., etc.\n\n**vayyiqra** (10): It's a 90s R&B LARP and it's perfect.\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (10): I just love this song so much\u2026 Like who knew a k-pop artist could actually do r&b without a bad backing track, wearing tacky braids, or butchering AAVE\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): \"you go girl\". this is one of the stronger early 2000 throwbacks that kpop's affinity for american hip hop/pop 'n b has gunned for and worked out. jive records radio ready mix/master\n\n**pheromenos** (9.3): omg thought we were still in the 90s r&b princesses section \ud83d\ude0d\n\n**stealthamo** (9): Kinda funny I think this is a better 90's R&B song than the two 90's R&B songs in this rate.\n\n**NervousLemon6670** (8.5): Genuinely thought until the vocals kicked in that this was part of the 90's R&B rate\n\n**kerriekipje** (8): I\u2019m giving this a point lower than I scored it in it\u2019s original rate because compared to the rest of these songs it\u2019s just kind of more underwhelming, also the fact that this song comes right after the actual r&b songs in the playlist is such a setup \ud83d\ude2d\n\n**qazz23** (8): has a good R&B sound\n\n**welcome2thejam** (8): Some solid pop&b\n\n**jman457** (7.6): Nice little 90\u2019s throwback moment\n\n**buildingigloos** (6): I thought this was another song from the 90s R&B Princesses rate then.

Ok I have very mixed feelings on this. On one hand, I think the song captures the the feelings of being torn between wanting to be with someone of the same gender but at the same time drowning in doubt and fear because you\u2019re in an unaccepting environment very well. It\u2019s a topic that hits close to home for me. That said, the only thing(s) keeping me from giving this an 10 is everything surrounding the band. Like, the whole band is the product of one creep projecting his lesbian fetish on these two teenage girls. Like, the things their manager made them do while underage is vile. Add on top of that one of the members being homophobic herself (despite being bi) and becoming a shill for the Russian government, I can\u2019t really give more points to this. Normally I\u2019m good with separating the art from the artist, but here I can\u2019t fully do that because of everything I just mentioned.

I know I'm on record as a Taylor anti & I promise I have really tried with this woman's music (a Swiftie sister has made sure of that), but absolutely nothing about this appeals - the lyrics feel childish, the cheerleader cadence similarly juvenile, and the vocals vaguely whiny - it's just grating in all the worst ways.\n\n---\n\n## Host comment\n\n**ignitethephoenix** (10): style better but this is still one of her best\n\n## so it's gonna be forever\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (11): there is another excellent contender in the rate that deserve an 11, but it\u2019s not pop perfection\n\n**ricki** (11): see i could have been fun and give the pussycat dolls my 11 but instead i gotta give it to the best song ever for a 4th time\n\n**skylofte2** (11): deserves 11 private jets for this\n\n**1998tweety** (10): her best pop hit\n\n**Ayzrules** (10): i\u2019m not a swiftie by any definition of the term but i do really really enjoy this song - the more minimalistic, rhythmic beat with a speak-singing melody over top is a perfectly manufactured key to my heart<3\n\n**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh this underrated, indie gem\u2026\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (10): This song and music video is the reason I became a late in life Swiftie in 2014.

    "Okay, hear me out here. \n\nYes, Rainbow Connection is a song from a kids movie, yes Kermit's voice is rough but think about the lyrics for a second. It's a direct rejection of the when you wish upon a star-style magical thinking - it's saying that that sort of blind faith in a divine intervention making your dreams come true only leads to disappointment and bitterness. It's about facing that bleak truth and still rejecting the pessimism that might come with that - the song still chooses to say \"there's good reason to be hopeful and to keep searching for happiness.\" If that's not worth songeniality I don't know what is.\n\n(And yes I wrote all that for a song sung by a felt puppet frog idc idc)",

Honestly this was GREAT fun, super catchy and doesn't take itself too seriously. Loving the bouncy feel and hoping this does well. [post rate closure stare of pain]\n\n---\n\n## Host comment\n\n**Ghost-Quartet** (10): There were \"better\" Remi Wolf songs I could have sent to this rate but if we're being honest, this was like THE Remi song that had everybody talking so it just felt right to keep the conversation going. I had the house to myself once so I stood in front of my bathroom mirror and sang along to this entire song, including the monologue at the end, and then realized afterwards that my stepmom was actually still downstairs and she heard the whole thing. We didn't talk about it.\n\n## paying their debts and stealing corvettes\n\n**Awkward\\_King** (11): there were too many amazing songs on juno for me to 11 this originally so i'm glad i get to here. this is really just non stop quotable lines, catchy as hell, it's just remi going off on the mic and its sickening this was maybe the point at which i went from just a remi listener to actually a remi diehard fan. ORGY AT FIVE GUYS WITH FIVE GUYS THATS TEN GUYS HOLY CHRIST I'VE NEVER SEEN MORE NUTS IN MY LIIIIIFE\n\n**apatel27** (10): If you get it you get it\n\n**Frajer** (10): I guess 212 isn't the only Bling Ring song in this rate if she's stealing cars\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (10): first ever Remi Wolf stream, and suddenly I understand her whole deal. I will be streaming Big Ideas posthaste\n\n**NFLfreak98** (10): probably as many quotable lines here than half of the rest of this rate combined\n\n**pbk** (10): the girls that get it get it (it=lost in the store and cant find my mommy)\n\n**RandomHypnotica** (10): Y'all should learn about the skip button, it's a great feature\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): oh she likes justin timberlake like me! oh she likes middle school pop like me! The entire MO of this cut is designed for \"AP Econ Music Videos\". If you KNOW what I'm talking about, then you know. the uwu shit at the end clenches it\n\n**wathombe** (10): banger\n\n**welcome2thejam** (10): Bitch!!!\n\n**CrimsonROSET** (9): the way y\u2019all did remi so wrong in the rate and this one is only gonna be worse\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this was so fun like the girls that get it get it yk\n\n**stealthamo** (9): What do you mean Pharrell didn't produce this?\n\n**Stryxen** (9): It's Oh So Quiet on Set\n\n**Ayzrules** (8.7): love this beat\n\n**slimboyfriend** (8.6): eating my ass like the human centipede!!\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (8): I have been meaning to listen to Remi Wolf. This song's maximalism works so well. I'm adding Juno to my queue.\n\n**vayyiqra** (8): Can never decide if Remi is fun or annoying or both but I'm vaguely positive on Remi if not an outright truther\n\n**bogo** (7): what is wrong with her\n\n**daftsone** (7): It\u2019s just a big ol\u2019 ball of fun\n\n**jirachi** (7): the 5 guys line still goes hard sorry\n\n**mustwinfullgaming** (7): okay I like this more than most Remi Wolf songs I've heard...human centipede reference too I see you girl\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (7): Some of the lyrics, jfc lol\n\n**team\\_kockroach** (7): First heard of this song because Fantano said it was one of his favorite songs of 2021. The production is a little too wonky for me, but I think this is a perfect fit for an All Stars rate.\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (7): Maybe this would be a 10 if it was just the chorus and the rest was instrumental\n\n**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): why does this song sound like Rock Your Body by JT \ud83d\ude2d\n\n**jman457** (6.8): Its catchy but the ending was catchy\n\n**ConnerY2323** (6.2): this suffers a bit when i\u2019m comparing it to tori amos instead of baby queen\n\n## debbie debbie debbie debbie downers\n\n**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I\u2019m sorry Remi. Most of the song is a bop, but I still dislike this outro. Thankfully, she will be in All Winners 5 after we rate Big Ideas :nodding:\n\n**jasannn** (6): I can't listen to this song without thinking about Dan Schnieder..\n\n**kerriekipje** (6): it\u2019s not for me but I can see why people would appreciate it\n\n**DirtyRat583** (5): what is it with music school students making the corniest music ever\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (5): popheads keep telling me she\u2019s good, but I just can\u2019t get into her music\n\n**implasdad** (5): its not that good really\n\n**babadork** (4.8): It could only be worse if the Red Hot Chili Peppers song got chosen\n\n**camerinian** (4): saw remi live literally within the past week and had a great time and I hoped that\u2019d help her music on record not come across so obnoxious but alas\n\n**Poydoo** (4): nice production but the rest is ehhhhh\n\n**Runaway3212** (4): some of these lines sound like they\u2019re straight out of an eminem song\n\n**icantlikeeveryone** (3): I think Remi Wolf is just not my taste, as I only like a handful of her songs, and this song is not one of those as it sounds super childish, but that's fine.\n\n**marbIeIily** (2.5): If I\u2019d used my zero this rate this probably would\u2019ve been the unlucky recipient, but the evil Mario game sounding beat just barely saved it\n\n**1998tweety** (2): this is not great Im sorry\n\n**indie\\_fan\\_** (1.2): there's a reason i skipped this rate [3]\n\n**asadprofessorplum** (0): This might be one of the worst songs of the entire century and I mean that so seriously. How did this sneak past the lashings it deserves?\n\n**flava** (0): maybe one of the worst songs we\u2019ve ever rated, just feels like the sonic equivalent of 2000s torture porn schlock with all the subtlety of a Michael Bay directed film and it turns me the fuck off. None of the lyrics in this song needed to be written, none of the melodies made needed to be made\n\n**ImADudeDuh** (0): https://i.imgur.com/ZyOV9l3.jpeg\n\n**nonchalantthoughts** (0): if the word annoying was a song\n\n## reminder that chappell had 7(!) songs in the top 10 and was obviously having a song voted in\n\n**ricki** (0): not only is this an awful song but it was also over any chappell roan song\n\n## she didn't do anything wrong!\n\n**frogaranaman** (10): the voice at the end is fine, you guys just force yourself to hate one artist per rate for some god forsaken reason\n\n**seanderlust** (10): This song rules please pretend you do not see the outro\n\n**lexiaredery** (9.5): This is so much fun to listen to on it's own kinda randomly and not in the midst of the album. I do have to lower my score because of the child at the end though\n\n**krusso1105** (8.5): Once again this would be higher rated without that outro. Also we need to rate Big Ideas.\n\n**Goorry121** (8): the outro takes 2 points out of the song\n\n**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Lots of good vibes up until that Angelica Pickles-ahh outro\n\n**qazz23** (8): like the low bass sounds on this, good flow also (yes that ending is bad but doesn't ruin the whole song)\n\n**Roxieloxie** (7.8): drives me insane how this song is actually so good and the outro just undoes all its good will in the outro to the point that makes me lower my score\n\n**uiscebeathaoir** (6.5): oh I\u2019d forgotten about the fucking baby\n\n**zadooi** (6): I initially scored this higher, but I hate the outro.\n\n**dreamingpastel** (5): I still don't really like that baby voice at the end.\n\n**hikk** (5): this is a really good two minute song\n\n**TiltControls** (4): Can I give this two different scores for the front half and back half? Like give me a '(Radio Edit)' version and I'll be all over that\n\n**NervousLemon6670** (3): If you put baby voice in the song you get tanked it's a very simple rule\n\n**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): me when im in a worst outro of all time competition and my opponent is remi wolf - quiet on set\n\n**impla77** (0): the baby section is irredeemable and I don't particularly enjoy the rest of the song either",

Please?\n\n**frogaranaman** (10): /u/RoxieLoxie correcting my sins\n\n**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/FQBzAyg.jpeg\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (10): nothing in the world is more iconic than the ay ay ay ay at the start, and we as a society need to start to realise that\n\n**pheromenos** (10): lowkey this song is so cute\n\n**Poydoo** (10): this total collapse\n\n**Runaway3212** (10): lowkey don\u2019t be mad at me but I was confused why this was here cause I was like\u2026 didn\u2019t this win\u2026 sorry to all the kosher stars\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (10): Fascinating the contrast between how much I enjoy Post Malone when he is using his vibrato (irrationally hate it) vs. when he isn't (enjoy (most of) it)\n\n**wathombe** (10): so good; what ever happened to that post Malone guy?\n\n**welcome2thejam** (10): Got a grin from ear to ear\n\n**WindysaStarStarStar** (10): also stream the Harry song pleek\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (9.2): Bring back Pop Malone\n\n**NervousLemon6670** (9): Post Malone sneaking into the Black Blockbusters rate, better add this to his controversies section\n\n**pbk** (9): the bop and a half\n\n**TiltControls** (9): A near perfect vibe track\n\n**uiscebeathaoir** (9): I love Swae Lee\u2019s voice so much\n\n**emayzee** (8.8): try not to romanticize 2019 and my pre-pandemic life challenge [FAILED]\n\n**1998tweety** (8.5): rare Post Malone & Swae Lee W\n\n**jman457** (8.3): The one Post Malone song ill give him a pass for\n\n**Nagisoid** (8): Defying Gravity for straight people\n\n**vayyiqra** (8): I don't get this guy but this is a good ditty\n\n**implasdad** (7.2): its sort of ok.. not marvellous\n\n**apatel27** (7): I thought this was overrated but the way people talk about it maybe its overhated\n\n**buildingigloos** (7): It's a good song but it was inescapable in 2019\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is one of those massive hits that I simply can\u2019t understand how they accomplished that\n\n**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): lord farquad pointing \u201cwhite\u201d meme.jpg\n\n**team\\_kockroach** (6.5): I\u2019d like to enjoy this more - I think Swae Lee puts in a really good performance - but it\u2019s something about the instrumental that turns me off a bit. Maybe it\u2019s the chord progression, or maybe it\u2019s the main melody that\u2019s too sparse?\n\n**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I will once again reiterate how weird it is that this song became known as some sunny feelgood bop when the lyrics are actually about a toxic relationship with a destructive woman.\n\n**krusso1105** (6): Tbh I would probably dislike this more if I didn't associate it with the excellent movie it comes from\n\n## people who are bad-bad nevertheless\n\n**babadork** (5.3): I really dislike Swae Lee\u2019s voice, but the contrast with Post Malone is kind of nice\n\n**Ambrosia42** (5): i still don\u2019t get the hype for this song idk. It\u2019s fine\n\n**ConnerY2323** (5): desperately needs fertilizer\n\n**RandomHypnotica** (5): not the worst song to be a stupidly massive hit... but certainly not the best either!!\n\n**Awkward\\_King** (4): has surprisingly grown on me since we rated her.. i get it a little bit now\n\n**camerinian** (4): so glad we\u2019re out of this anemic \u201cvibes only\u201d era\n\n**daftsone** (4): A song that does not live up to the highs the movie it\u2019s from reached\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): i mean this might be the least impactful song ever\n\n**impla77** (4): wow listening to this twice for rates has pushed this into the overplay territory for me again!\n\n**stealthamo** (4): I only found this okay when it first came out. Years of overplay have greatly eroded my enjoyment.\n\n**icantlikeeveryone** (3): Basic soundtrack.\n\n**jirachi** (3): yeah this is still boring\n\n**qazz23** (2): this is so fucking irritating\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (0): I'm saving all of my hate for this one. It is just so grating.\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (0): i took 3 videos on 3 separate nights of me getting baked and flipping a coin so this is more a \"you underperformed and if you got 9th you're not a real all star\" ass irrational meta 0 on behalf of how much trouble that caused me. I've come to realize that post-malone's natural goober boy glow prolly has inadvertently caused a rise in the number of tik tok musical artists destined for catatonic youths comps or review goofs stuck in purgatory.",

Very much camp.\n\n**stealthamo** (6): The most 2014 song. I honestly don't know if I mean that as a compliment or an insult.\n\n**welcome2thejam** (6): This is what happens when we the let the Chainsmokers do We Live in a Society bits\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): i mean this is just a bucketful of early 2010s nostalgia slapped across the face\n\n**FitzMarble** (5): this should be taught in schools\n\n**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is such a time capsule for many reasons but man, remember when selfies were this wild outlandish new thing that the kids were obsessed with and now it's just, like, normal and expected from everyone?

The only way this could\u2019ve been redeemed is if there were 69 songs in AS8 and there just isn\u2019t so.

I have really mixed feelings on this track myself and I always find myself struggling with how to score it. It IS undeniably catchy, with an addictive bassline, a gorgeously sparkly pre-chorus, and an admittedly incredibly catchy chorus. I'm also a total sucker for chant-vocals in tracks, so I have to admit that it's lots of fun and I can see why it's so well-loved. That said... I *want* to give this points for its ridiculous (camp?) lyrics, but I always find myself kind of wrapped up with how the supposed 'be yourself' message of the song feels totally at odds with the way (G)-IDLE market themselves. It feels more than a little disingenuous to focus the track on self-love, rejecting surgery etc. while also filling the video with filters and heavily edited shots. I'm almost certainly thinking too much about this, but these obnoxious feminist thoughts kind of cloud my enjoyment of the track whenever I hear it, so I'm deducting a few points on that basis.\n\n---\n\n##  Host comments\n\n**1998tweety** (10): the girls that get it get it and the girls that don't arent hot\n\n## sing it with me in the queup\n\n**CrimsonROSET** (10): she\u2019s right\u2026 my boob AND booty is hot\n\n**dreamingpastel** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQBzkfCtZKE\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): KWINKA!

It's minimal and restrained, which I guess might be interpreted as a little dull (7 minutes of this no less) - but listen closely, and those darkly murmured lyrics about lack of self-worth in the face of a patriarchal society cut *deep*. The switch-up is both inexplicable and makes perfect sense, this moody transition into a bitter, repetitive, almost defeated refrain reflects her mental state. I have heard this quite a few times, but it always makes me stop to collect my thoughts and reflect on the miserable state of modern womanhood. I think it's worth a solid score for that alone.\n\n**beeozan** (6): unexpectedly grew on me once i stopped taking it seriously lol. it still sounds like Vigilante shit once it switches. thats pretty funny. jimi jimi coco puff jimi jimi yaaa. need a mashup of the second half with My Humps\n\n---\n\n## thank u ricki\n\n**letsallpoo** (10): tagging myself so i know when to join queup to watch ricki's video again u/letsallpoo\n\n**Nagisoid** (10): The ricki shitpost lives rent free in my head\n\n**Runaway3212** (10): I think about ricki\u2019s stan twitter shitpost for this every day\n\n**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): ricki\u2019s music video singlehandedly made this grow on me\n\n**TiltControls** (8): this would be a 4 without ricki's video. it's amazing what good visuals can do to help you appreciate music\n\n**CrimsonROSET** (7): the ricki video kinda the best campaign move because why did it make me raise my score for this\n\n**welcome2thejam** (6): Still don't care for it, but I'm increasing the score thanks to the power of the Ricki A&W edit that is hopefully currently playing in the queup\n\n**pbk** (1): spared of a 0 bc we get to watch the ricki video again\n\n## we already listened to enough jason derulo on the queup\n\n**NervousLemon6670** (7.3): During the back half I kept expecting it to launch into \"Shimmy shimmy yay shimmy yay shimmy yah (DRANK) swallallalah\"\n\n## \"oh i am a big fan of prostitution\"\n\n**icantlikeeveryone** (11): The song that officially made me LDR's fan lol, it's supposed to be sad but somehow I fck with it so much and looped this while commuting.\n\n**jman457** (11): Best song ever made idc\u2026..\n\n**1998tweety** (10): sometimes the most popular song really is the best [2]\n\n**Awkward\\_King** (10): i must admit i didn't think she'd release anything this phenomenal again. it felt like NFR was a perfect odds defying swan song and then there was question for the culture and two lackluster albums in one year it felt like NFR was a magical one-time gift of her talent used perfectly. but A&W is just.... she's still got it man she's never losing it, even if it can be fleeting.. what a song\n\n**buildingigloos** (10): I first listened to this with my girlfriend and when the breakdown came we both looked at each other like we couldn't believe how good it was. It still gives me chills. This is the experience of being an American whore.\n\n**ConnerY2323** (10): some of you can\u2019t handle a sprawling american epic. why is this kinda the brutalist of songs.\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (10): Lana's best song out of her entire career. I just love when that trap beat comes in and she scats about jimmy cocoa puff. Unfortunately, Jack Antonoff has had a hand in nearly all of the the pop music I that love. This was my runner-up for an 11 rating\n\n**Frajer** (10): boo you American whore\n\n**hikk** (10): this is going to flop so bad here probably which is crazyyyyy\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (10): this won\u2019t win, but it\u2019s the song that deserves it the most\n\n**impla77** (10): how will you know if someone hates this song? dw they'll tell you like 10 times\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (10): the pushback on this one I don\u2019t get, surely it\u2019s obviously the best song ever made? hating this is denialism on par with moon landing doubt tbh\n\n**uiscebeathaoir** (10): this was so robbed it\u2019s insanity\n\n**wathombe** (10): brilliant brilliant brilliant\n\n**krusso1105** (9.5): would easily be a 10 in a less stacked rate\n\n**team\\_kockroach** (9.5): Yeah, this one\u2019s fucking peak, and I have a hard time believing that Antonoff can top this song. I hope no one tanks it in this rate.\n\n**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Lots of songs are elevated by rate shitposts, but not as many are ascended by them.\n\n**vayyiqra** (9): Under no circumstances do we \"have to hand it\" to Lana,\n\n**WindysaStarStarStar** (9): Jimmy Choos are making her high? Is she a shopaholic?\n\n**nonchalantthoughts** (8.9): I used to be obsessed with this song\n\n**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): https://i.imgur.com/fgP4zSL.png\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (8): Anybody else have those KFC + A&W combos in the same building? Similar to the Taco Bell + Long John Silver combo buildings? God Bless America\n\n**seanderlust** (8): i think antonoff over-saturation has waned enough for us to all admit that sometimes he really can eat\n\n**NFLfreak98** (7.8): production on this is incredible but the first part lasts too long and to this day I still don\u2019t think I love the melody of the second part. Sounds beautiful all the way though just a lot of missed opportunities to me\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (7.8): lana del ray's mild ride. to quote the wise words of u/freav she is truly one of america's most \"reliable\" songwriters!\n\n**Ayzrules** (7.7): i really enjoy her voice, but it feels like nothing is happening for 80% of the song. Tbh it\u2019s a testament to how much i enjoy LDR that i\u2019m not tanking this song in general, if any other song spent like 3 full minutes with just vague instrumental backbeat going on it\u2019d be an instant 1 for me. [insert something about how my brain rot goldfish attention span is a sign that the YOUTHS cant be saved]\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (7.7): First she pretends to be Latina (changes her last name), now she pretends to be Asian (says she lives in Rosemead)\n\n**mustwinfullgaming** (7): I don't normally gel with Lana's music but this song is pretty good! I like it for how long it is and the 2 distinct phases it has\n\n**Poydoo** (7): idk this song has really never done a ton for me, I wish something else from the album made it in tbh\n\n**stealthamo** (7): My headcanon is she's talking to Jimmy from Degrassi.\n\n**zadooi** (7): It's good, but I truly do not get the hype with this song. Maybe I'm just a Lana hater.",

    "it sold almost as much as original did in first week back in 2019 (47k vs 53k)",
    "It's honestly impressive to think how long it took for the girls to beat Madonna on something considering she did what she did without social media.",
    "She's pretty much a lock to break the record at this rate right?\n\n  \nShe has 13, above her include the Beatles, and Robbie Williams at 15. I presume one of them might release 1 more? (perhaps the soundtrack for the upcoming Beatles movie?).\n\n  \nIf the number to beat is 16, she's still far from retirement.",
    "Yeah well im still salty I didn't get the repressing. Shit sold out in minutes BOTH TIMES.",

My favourite live performance from Taylor especially Cornelia St. I wish she\u2019d put it on streaming, she\u2019d have gotten another no1 on Billboard if she had, just missed out to Bad Bunny by 1000 units but her no2 charted by pure sales alone. Unbelievable.\u2764\ufe0f",

    "Well deserved, it is one of the prettiest vinyl i've ever seen.",
    "Interesting headline given that one record includes four re-recordings and a live album. With that being said, T's selling power is unmatched at the moment.",
    "Wait she released again?",
    "Crazy that #5 is Short n Sweet's lowest position in the UK yet and it's been out for six months. Guaranteed to  rise if not return to no. 1 next week with the deluxe dropping",
    "And not just like, winning an easy week or anything either, we're talking better than Eternal Sunshine's first week, better than Cowboy Carter's first week. In fact better than every other album in any week of the last year besides: TTPD, Moon Music, Short n Sweet, Hit Me Hard and Soft, Definitely Maybe (25th Anniversary), and Songs for a Lost World. Just absolutely insane\u00a0",
    "Everyone wanted the heart-shaped vinyl. She definitely could have printed more, and it still would have sold out. She sold out 150k in the first hour",
    "A lot of her stuff is bought up by resellers. I know a girl who (with her \"team\") bought up TTPD vinyls, thinking they'd be easy to resell because of the frenzy but she ended up being out thousands of dollars and couldn't even resell them near cost. Her new plan is to storage them to sell in a few years. There definitely are fans who buy them up (obviously) but resellers jump in fast.",
    "It's just numbers, it has no cultural impact. Madonna's discography remains a reference and staple to pop music. Wtf is Lover (Live from Paris)?",
    "Wait that\u2019s actually completely insane lmao. She\u2019s really become such a global powerhouse after the Eras Tour.",
    "I don\u2019t understand why this is randomly charting so well and hit no.1 ( THIS CAME OUT AGES AGO??)",
    "Impressive but on the other hand Madonna had TV (esp. MTV), a lot of radio play, a lot of promotion in paper media, greatest hits compilations (Taylor has none for sale) on her side. Social media is useless if you don't already have popularity irl.",
    "Yeah, Rep TV and Debut TV still to come out and likely TS12 after that. There\u2019s the next 3 number ones.",
    "One of my favorite performances. I only wish Taylor had done backing vocals here, but it was so good.",
    "Hi, Lover live from Paris is available to stream Spotify? I listen to it constantly lol especially like you said Cornelia street, it IS the superior version for me. Unless I'm misunderstanding you mean by streaming?",
    "Most albums are collectors albums at this point, majority of people stream or buy digital copies.",
    "Madonna's records includes two greatest hits and ~~three~~ four (?) live albums, so they're pretty comparable! Super impressive for both artists.",
    "No they\u2019ve only just shipped in the UK this week",
    "The demand is insane for Taylor's music. People just can't get enough of her music.",
    "Lmao scalper resellers are trash, lowkey deserved to lose that money",
    "The first release was before covid hit and she only released 13000 vinyl copies so most fans missed out the first time. It\u2019s not available on streaming so we all jumped at the chance to get a copy when she quietly released another batch this year. She could easily have sold 4x the amount she put out, it was still a limited release this time around. I can only imagine the numbers if she released it digitally and on streaming with some PR.",
    "It\u2019s a heart-shaped vinyl. Even disregarding the music on it, if you\u2019re a vinyl collector and your favorite artist releases a vinyl that\u2019s weird and cool like that, wouldn\u2019t you jump at the chance to nab one?",
    "Cultivated a huge base of whales/collectors who are competing to own everything she releases.",
    "Also I don't know why this thread is acting like Madonna only released hits in like the 80s/90s. Madonna also benefited from social media for her later releases, her last UK no.1 album was in 2012! Her and Taylor Swift have a long period of overlap too!",
    "Madonna also existed when you had to leave the house to buy an album and the charts mattered.\u00a0",
    "The songs on Spotify don't count as a lover live from paris unit, but it\u00a0 counts towards the studio lover album for some reason.",
    "It's on YouTube music too. Listen to it all the time, have been forever.",
    "I'm pretty sure 95% of people just stream, except maybe for one or two albums a year at most\u00a0",
    "That includes me\ud83e\udd23 I just love her voice and her lyrics and storytelling. She\u2019s risen to the top and stayed there in spite of people trying to bring her down and that\u2019s why she has so many loyal fans.",
    "Plus - folklore brought on a lot of new fans (like me!) who was totally unaware of this the first time round. I couldn't buy it this time round either lmao, but I would have liked to!",
    "Good point. Madonna benefited from the old and new system.",
    "Social media started to be massive only in 2010-2011 lol, so no Madonna didn't have social media throughout most of her career, especially her career highs we're all without social media.",
    "I know that she\u2019s never going to be considered a vocal powerhouse, but for me I don\u2019t always need or want to listen to belting (even if I can appreciate it). I\u2019ve just always loved her tone, especially speak now and on.",

    "OOOOOOOOOHHHHHH YES. Tate showcases her Britney influence to the fullest, this sounds like something that came out of In the Zone. Love the whispery chorus as well. Could use a bridge, though. 8/10",
    "i haven't been feeling her other songs this era but this one HITS... just crazy catchy and the 00s pastiche production is spot on. i love when she goes \"where'd you put those keys\" and the car cars it tickles my brain 9/10",
    "As a certified Tate Stan, this SLAPS!! The whisper chorus is a different sonic direction for her, whilst the production still feels familiar and cohesive compared to the previous two singles. This is definitely the type of song she shines the most on.\n\n10/10",
    "Tate McRae\u2026 hasn\u2019t missed?\n\nThe singer-dancer has never felt like a \u201cno skips\u201d artist to me. She went from feeling like a boring Billie Eilish clone to an \u201csometimes fun\u201d Olivia Rodrigo clone to a Walmart-brand Nelly Furtado-alike. The latter direction seemed like something of a breakthrough at first, utilizing both her dance abilities and nasally rasp in a setting that fit them, but *Think Later* ended up only having a few good songs, weighed down by forgettable ballads. \u201cGreedy\u201d was the undeniable standout, with only a one or two other songs even approaching that level\n\nWith 3 rock solid singles out, that is not what\u2019s happened with her upcoming album\n\n\u201cSports car,\u201d the third release from *So Close To What*, is the best of the bunch. The past few singles have harkened back to the danceable pop sound that \u201cGreedy\u201d did so well, but \u201cSports car\u201d adds a level of sexiness to the mix, and it pushes the track to a new level. Whispered choruses can be a risk, but this one works perfectly, contributing to the tension the song evokes\n\nThe biggest thing that sets this apart from the other singles is Tate\u2019s delivery. I\u2019ve not always been the biggest fan of her voice, but she *sells* this song, even more than she did on \u201cGreedy\u201d to be honest. She delivers the song on the razor-thin edge between \u201cteasing\u201d and \u201cready to combust from horniness,\u201d and she sounds like she\u2019s having the time of her goddamn life. Never underestimate the power of a pop singer who sounds like they\u2019re having fun singing the song\n\nOver the past 2 years or so, Tate has refined a sound and aesthetic that fit her, and \u201cSports car\u201d is probably the best 3 minutes of that sound she\u2019s released\n\n8.5/10",
    "I love this. A win for whisper singing. Definitely hear the 00\u2019s vibe and I am obsessed with it. 9/10",
    "Tate McRae, attempting to be sexy: \"Oh golly gee!\" \n\nThis song pretty much just follows the Ava Max formula: Take a song that zillennials like (this time mid 2000s radio pop) and say generically catchy things over its beat. It's fine in concept, if not just boring, but every time I actually hear the lyrics through her mushy enunciation, I'm taken aback by how deeply corny she's acting. \n\n[5]",
    "I was not at all expecting this collaboration, but alas, it worked! Bruno Mars gets freaky in that ass-shaking-worthy chorus, and Sexyy Red charms with her characteristically carnal lyrics. I love how this beat perfectly fits Sexyy's flow, which is very unique and needs a specific beat to sound good. But anyway. FAT JUICY AND WET. WET. WET. WET. 7/10",
    "YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD PUNANI LIKE THIS :yelling:\n\nYeah this is fun. Once you get past the CupcaKke-like obscene lyrics (if you need to get past that at all) you're left with a song that has incredibly smooth production courtesy of Bruno and his frequent collaborators The Stereotypes. Bruno and Sexyy also seem to have pretty good chemistry on the track! Sexyy Red has for whatever reason not really clicked with me in the past, but this song is an exception.\n\n8/10",
    "On first listen I was so baffled, but it\u2019s definitely grown on me. Some of the lyrics are a little questionable coming from Bruno in my personal opinion. To quote a stan twitter reference it appears they were trying to reheat WAP nachos. But they have a great chemistry and the beat is great. 6/10",
    "My current fave on the album!! Obsessed with the chorus, I love how much softer it is compared to the verses, her voice sounds so gently and calming compared to the verses which are more aggressive.\n\n9/10",
    "Probably my favourite moment on this album is the last chorus exploding over twigs yelling (Cranberriesly) with that light breakbeat underneath. Other than that there are some really great melodies throughout and her non-yodelling voice is stunning as usual. Hypnotising and dynamic instrumentals and a unique Twigs twist on the ray of light manual, and just a really great song! 9/10",
    "I do really like this track, but I have to admit that it\u2019s one of my less preferred ones on what I think is a stellar album. I love how twigs blends danceability with her classically vulnerable lyrics, and I\u2019m especially fond of how this track opens up in the latter portion, exploding into frenetic breakbeat that encapsulates both the rave scenes she is paying homage to and the emotional breakdown conveyed in the track. At first, I wasn\u2019t crazy about how discordant and sing-songy the vocal melody is (and that is part of my reason for the lack of perfect 10), but after I got to see this live at the ON performance I kind of \u2018got\u2019 what she was trying to do with it, connoting a hypnotic and introspective atmosphere that reflects her inner brooding. Lovely piece & I really like the direction twigs took with this album. 8.6/10",
    "One of the most inspirational songs in recent memory. What I especially love about this song is that it doesn't really try too hard. Many songs feel like they're trying really hard to be this inspirational banger, and what makes this song an inspirational banger is how natural it all seems. Not to mention that this song has been a great help to me when I'm sad. 10/10",
    "Mother is innocent.  She only had one match but she made  herstory \n\n9/10",
    "This song gets clowned on sometimes but honestly at the right moment this is a perfect song. You have to appreciate the sonic construction - simple, sad piano gives way into cliche-but-effective inspirational drums and little backing vocal adlibs. And obviously rachel slays with the singing and selling the lyrics! Sometimes you really do feel like a little boat on the ocean...\n\n10/10",
    "Sorry but this chorus just triggers my flight response. How many times can we rhyme song with song??? Kind of annoying bc the verses are okay and she has a really nice voice.\n\n4/10\u00a0",
    "Vapid, cheap, and obnoxious. One of the most derivative songs of the century, with a clear lineage from the feel-good power pop of the late 2000s/early 2010s. However, Fight Song does nothing, aside from pissing me off, better than any of the songs that came before it. I\u2019m sure Ms. Platten is a nice lady, but she unfortunately released the corniest song of all time with this one. A genuinely better version of this song is \u201cThis is Not a Feminist Song\u201d from SNL\n\n1/10",
    "The best song of all time. Changed lives and saved them too, an inspirational hymn 10/10",
    "It's beyond over-dramatic, corny, self-aggrandising, embarrassing whatever... sometimes life is embarrassing! and you just have to feel all of that! If you ever see me looping this (and it happens a lot), know I'm going through something extremely character-defining and I will be coming back stronger... I've still got a lotta fight left in me. This song makes me feel something no other song has ever elicited in me, it's really that serious. 10/10",
    "Possibly the most \"millennial liberal\" song of all time, which is why I understand its detractors because that's a double whammy of uncool. That said, I've always found this to be genuinely catchy with a great buildup and vocals, which makes the self-empowerment theme work for me when it rarely does. 10/10",
    "One of his best?? I love how the song stops and starts up again. Incredible lyrics, catchy, and a bit of an interesting shift from the last album! Probably the On The Floor of this album, but I really love the rock angle. \n\n9.5/10",
    "My aoty so far and my fave new artist discovery!! It\u2019s not one of my top songs on the album but it\u2019s still really fun and a lowkey bop.\u00a0\n\nVerses >> chorus here. I really love the delivery of \u201cin a city of strangers you\u2019re the only one that I want.\u201d She is so right tho with \u201cparty people LIVE and party people FUCK\u201d\u00a0\n\n8.5/10",
    "Not my fav song on the album, but it is a great album and I wish as many people would actually listen to it as well as just saying how great the album cover is lol. Great production all around and a fun party vibe  7/10",

    "I don't know if this counts but Ed Sheeran's Eyes Closed was originally about missing a lover after a breakup and dancing in the club while being heartbroken, he later rewrote parts of it and now it talks about missing a love one that passed away.\u00a0\n\n\nBTS does this with practically most of their songs, but of the top of my head Paradise written by MNEK, and he said in an interview that it was originally about partying,\u00a0 BTS rewrote it and it now it talks about dreams and how it's okay to slow down and enjoy the journey and stuff.",
    "There's a lot on Artpop. Aura was originally Infected Mushroom's demo called Kink. Donatella was a completed demo by Zedd and some khia called Karma Bitch, she took the instrumental as it is and wrote new lyrics and melody for it. Same with Mary Jane Holland, the OG demo is titled Can't Beat The Machines.",
    "[Out Of The Woods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGTUvzbtpbg) was also an instrumental Taylor wrote over, along with most of folklore and a few songs on evermore.  \n  \nI actually think she really flourishes in this mode, I wish she'd go back to it.",
    "Someone else already mentioned this but this happens all the time when demos are translated. Kpop songs are often originally in English and then bought and changed to fit the language and rhyme scheme. SM had done this a lot for a long time and I can think of a lot of songs from HYBE artists that have done the same",
    "I know Taylor has talked about some instrumentals (I think ones of Evermore) having already been created by her producer and then she heard them and wrote over them. I\u2019m also 99% sure there\u2019s a Blackpink-only demo of Sour Candy, which I\u2019m assuming means Gaga worked on that song after a full version already existed. \n\nIn general my guess is that even artists known for having a heavy hand in their music use more stuff than we might think that was made previously by their producers or from demos that were floated their way.",
    "A few songs from Folklore and Evermore by Taylor Swift had been used in parts of National songs. Dorothea was their version of Give it to Teddy in Bob\u2019s Burgers.",
    "Lady Gaga has definitely rewritten demos. A lot of artists who got started writing, or did a lot of demo work early on went on to release either their own version, or songs that just never got picked up. Sia does this, too.",
    "Dua Lipa has an unreleased version (demo) of the song Borderline which she helped write. Tove Lo ended up using it and changed some lyrics and the view point of the song. Both are on YouTube so it\u2019s fun to listen to both!",
    "Rewriting a demo is different from writing a top line to an instrumental. \n\nA lot of artists will get a demo then swap a few words or a verse without fundamentally changing the melody or lyrics. \n\nTaylor has talked a lot about her process, you can find tons of her demos and interviews. I haven't seen as much for the others. How she's described it is sometimes a parallel process. She's always writing melodies and lyrics, they're always making beats and instrumentals. Sometimes she sends/brings it to them and asks for a particular instrumental vibe, sometimes they send/brings something they're working on it and she writes to it. \n\nWe know there's a few times where Jack or Aaron had an instrumental they'd pitched to someone else who passed, then she picked it up. Like Lavender Haze was initially pitched to Zoe Kravitz. But that doesn't she ever had the other artist's demo and was working off it.",

    "Fergie's glamorous instrumental was originally a remix of Luxurious by Gwen.

    "Come To Mama on Joanne was also a Father John Misty demo!",
    "Yup, though Aura is mostly original from the chorus onwards, and MJH had many small changes made to better fit Gaga\u2019s melodies. Donatella is exactly the same.\n\nThere\u2019s also a couple from Chromatica. If I\u2019m not mistaken Sour Candy was a demo for Blackpink and Sine From Above was intended to be a collab between Swedish House Mafia and Elton John.",

    "Most of TTPD is written over instrumentals so\u2026",
    "Most of her songs nowadays are written over track, though. She mostly stopped writing harmonies for them after 1989. Taylor still writes melodies and lyrics, but the only modern songs we know for a fact she wrote the harmonies for are \"exile\" and \"betty\" (via the folklore doc)",
    "I dont know if it counts but the only one I can think of is Kesha/Girls Generation - Run Devil Run. Any other examples?\n\n(Actually I recall a song\u2019s melody by Duffy being used for a kpop song too)",
    "The Sour Candy demo was recorded by Madison Love who originally wrote the song for Blackpink. Somehow the song got onto Gaga\u2019s desk first, and she invited Blackpink on as a feature when she learned who it was originally meant for. Kind of a cool story of how pop songs get passed around multiple hands before being claimed and released.",
    "All the songs cowritten by Aaron Dessner on Folklore were his instrumentals that she wrote lyrics to. Willow was written in the same way but I'm not sure about the rest of Evermore because at that point lockdown was lifted and they could be in the same room together.",
    "invisible string and happiness were originally the national songs that taylor rewrote the top line for",
    "Wait what?! lol",
    "I think  Give it to Teddy is the only  one that is available online.",
    "This doesn't fit OP's question perfectly though, I think they were talking about rewriting only the lyrics specifically. \"dorothea\" and \"Give It to Teddy\" share instrumentals (since Aaron composed the harmonies on most folkmore songs), but they don't have the same melody, as Taylor rewrote the melody as well.",

    "Sour Candy's production was heavily modified from the original. The demo is out there. It even has the same English lyrics as the visualizer for BP's parts.",
    "this isn\u2019t true. On her most recent album she had 5 completely self written songs",
    "OP doesn\u2019t necessarily mean remakes of other released songs, but songs where the lyrics changed from the demos to the final, I think.\n\nIf you watch SM behind the scenes videos with members reacting to demos you can often hear the original English lyrics (Walk and Baggy Jeans are two recent examples)! A lot of the composers, songwriters and producers they use in their songwriting camps are foreign so it makes sense they would write English/placeholder lyrics to be replaced with Korean by SM\u2019s lyricists.",
    "An FX song was originally Boyfriend Material for Ariana Grande",
    "That was also Girls\u2019 Generation- they released their version of \u201cMercy\u201d as \u201cDancing Queen.\u201d",
    "Reminds me of Gaga trying to give Britney \"Telephone\", but she already had a song on Circus called \"Phonography\" and she didn't want two phone-related songs on the album. So Gaga kept Telephone.",
    "She wrote the topline, which is both melody and lyrics.",
    "According to Aaron Dessner, he sent over the instrumental to Willow and she sent back the lyrics 10 minutes later.",
    "Not all of them, exile and betty weren't Aaron demos",
    "She wrote lyrics and top melody*",
    "Guess the magic drug that has me hooked on evermore is Aaron Dessner. It\u2019s such a distinct album from all of her works, and for me the instrumentals were my favourite part along with some of the lyricism.",

    "They weren\u2019t created specifically for The Fame, no.",
    "The fame album no",
    "LMFAO. Omg....Love how they try to make you think its about dancing and  Jagger's iconic moves on stage. Its not, really. Jagger was a very well known for sleeping around (rumors with both men and women). Actually read the lyrics and you'll see its not exactly about dancing. They probably implied it was to \"keep it clean.\" so the radio would play it. Do you seriously think that a person who wrote the song \"Sugar\" would write such an innocent song about dancing? LOL - a couple lines from the song...\n\n**You want to know how to make me smile**  \n**Take control, own me just for the night**\n\n**Take me by the tongue**  \n**And I'll know you**  \n**Kiss til you're drunk**  \n**And I'll show you**\n\n  \nUm, yeah....its about *dancing.*",
    "I\u2019ve heard it, the main differences are the completely revamped instrumental and Gaga\u2019s verse, everything BP sings plus the chorus is mostly the same.",
    "True. She has the sole writing credits for My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys, Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?, The Black Dog, Peter, and The Manuscript.",
    "All of her co-writes are also not necessarily to track",
    "And the world is greater for the Gaga Telephone.",
