    "Not sure what you\u2019re talking about man. There are tons of new bands making great music right now. You just have to know where to find them. It\u2019s not older bands fault that new bands aren\u2019t more popular. Commercial radio stations don\u2019t play new, up and coming bands and MTV doesn\u2019t play music videos anymore. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t good music out there. It\u2019s just not being promoted by big labels and radio stations like back in the day. This isn\u2019t Kiss\u2019 fault. It\u2019s Universal Music Group, Sony Music Group, and Warner Music Group\u2019s fault. These companies decide what gets popular. And they play it safe. These big companies are risk averse. So if you want to listen to good music you have to find it on your own.",

Do you mean before the *band* turns 40 or before the *musicians* turn 40, because either way, you are being ageist as *hell*.

    "Define \u201cRock\u201d music? Do you listen to the Rolling Stones?  When was the last time they got a Grammy? I guess life ends at 40 huh? If you haven\u2019t created something worthwhile by 40 quit? What does age have to do with it. \nI feel bad for you, if at 51 you feel this way how do you have anything left to look forward to. I am quite a bit older than you, I have seen music change, Rock as well as what they used to call Country. \nSo tell Stevie Wonder to Stop, Santana, and you mentioned U2, so who else? Coldplay? \nThe music I listened to, my Generation, was the Beetles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Eagles,Led Zeppelin, Linda Ronstadt,Tom Petty,Queen, The Who, Eric Clapton, James Taylor,Talking Heads,Steely Dan, Lou Reed,ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Jim Croce, Nazareth,Al Green,Heart,and many more. It was in my opinion the best music, bands and singers in all time. Not only could we listen to these bands we could see them in concert and we didn\u2019t have to sell a kidney to do it. Yeah, it may have been festival seating but who cared. There may have been some passing around of smoking material, from people that we didn\u2019t know, but everyone was chill, it was a different time, if I could go back and see those bands again I might, I did see Elvis Costello in the early 2000\u2019s it was great, but you can\u2019t capture that magic again. But to say they are getting Grammy\u2019s and not allowing new talent? Maybe politics could enter into it. I\u2019ve seen what has gone on the few times I\u2019ve watched. \u201csour grapes\u201d this person has had this many Grammys but can\u2019t get best album. If enough people whine about it, maybe they will get it, even if someone else may actually be more qualified for that category. I don\u2019t care who gets what but how old are these people? \nI hope things work out so you feel better about rock, or Rock v Heavy Metal. No one should feel bad when listening to music. It even calms down my Great Pyrenees when she gets grouchy, so I wish it would do that for everyone. \nOh and today, on Valentine\u2019s Day go have a listen to \u201cThree Dog Night\u201d Just an old fashioned love song, it is one of their older ones, but a goodie. Music should make you feel good, if it doesn\u2019t, find something else that does. It\u2019s all about memories to me.",
    "I love new music!  You know, like from the eighties!",
    "Strange that you take away that from my post. It's the very opposite. There are a lot of great new bands. But it's like The Stones or The Beatles come up with a mediocre album or a half a song everybody's in awe. And I never listened to any chart in my life by the way.",
    "That partial is a reason. But what if, let's say U2 quit in 2000? Record labels would have needed to adapt and promote new bands to radiostations. But they didn't and I believe that didn't trigger their label to sign new talent. The same with festivals. They complain that there aren't any new rock bands and bands are aging. Rock bands are still a major pull for people to buy tickets.\u00a0\nUntil the 90s festivals helped making new bands. After that they kept signing the same old bands because festivals were on a high and people had money to burn. So why risk anything. But that kept younger bands back.\nAnd sure times changed. Streaming, radio everything is readily available to find new music. But I'd like to see this young bands make it as big as well.\u00a0",
    "I deliberately restricted myself to bands. Artists making music, no matter what age, should make music till they drop. And of course I'm over exaggerating some what. But I still think that every decennium deserves their own musical heroes without old acts \"being in their way\". Let Fleetwood Mac be a band from the 70s and 80s. Like The Stones should have stayed a band from the 60s and 70s and U2 from the 80s and 90s. The 2010s and 20s need their own big names.",
    "Really? The Stones and The Beatles won Grammy's this year!?\u00a0\nYou play whatever you like. And artists should make new music until they die. I don't mind at all and I love music from the 60s onward.\u00a0",
    "People like what they like. And those bands earned their respect as much as any new band out there stuggling.\n\nDo you want to dictate what people listen to? You might get a nice job at Spotify if you do.",
    "Young rock bands aren\u2019t gonna get big the way they used to in the 60s through the 90s unless there is some sort of cultural shift. TikTok decides what is popular now and currently that means vapid pop music. And if you go by what these corporations dictate as popular, you will be very disappointed. However, take a band like King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. They have a huge following with fans around the world. They\u2019ve put out 26 studio albums since 2012, tour constantly with each concert selling out and they don\u2019t show any signs of slowing down any time soon. But you won\u2019t hear them on mainstream radio or in Super Bowl commercials. They are still considered an indie band. If they would have come out in the 70s they would probably be as big as Led Zeppelin or Rush.\n\nThe culture needs to change. I don\u2019t know what it would take for that to happen but I often think about when Nevermind came out in 1991. At the time rock was dominated by glam and hair bands and the number one artist was Michael Jackson. Nevermind ended up unseating Michael Jackson from the number 1 spot and grunge became mainstream overnight. Preppy kids and jocks started wearing flannel shirts and Converse and every record label was looking for the next Nirvana. The music in the 90s was pretty great as a result. We\u2019ve had a lot of great bands since Nirvana but the culture has slipped back in to pushing pop music like it was in the 80s. So the culture needs to change if we want to see a resurgence in rock music.",
    "One of U2\u2019s more under appreciated songs was written in the 2000\u2019s. It\u2019s called \u201cStuck in a Moment\u201d, and Bono wrote it about Michael Hutchence from INXS. It was overplayed to shit when it was released, but it\u2019s not a bad song. The Rolling Stones also continued to have good output in the 80\u2019s. \n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying that the situation with the Grammys isn\u2019t fucked up, but your blame is misplaced. The problem isn\u2019t with the artists it\u2019s with the record industry as a whole.",
    "Casey I agree, I was replying to to the original poster. If you\u2019re good you get noticed.

But the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s were my years, 70\u2019s High School and boy did we have the GREATEST MUSIC!  And the Concerts WOW! No ticket Master.

    "I have a strong disdain for all of these award shows. But as a musician my disdain for the Grammys are unmatched. It\u2019s a ceremony of autofellation. Talented musicians do win awards, and honestly every single recipient is probably very talented, that not the point. They dont need this validation. 99% of music created in a year isn\u2019t even considered for any given category. But what I don\u2019t understand is why there\u2019s an audience and why that audience gets upset if their favorite doesn\u2019t win. I don\u2019t need to state the obvious but I will, they do not care about music or musicians they care about money and selling the albums and artists like Beyonc\u00e9,Kendrick Lamar, or Taylor swift don\u2019t gain an real fans or followers nor do they need to from winning these awards and I hope some serious heavy hitters in the music industry start to stand up for smaller musicians some day",
    "i mean some of these winners for AOTY and SOTY are pretty egregious tho",
    "\n\nLet's be clear, music is subjective, and it can be hard to argue on both sides on whether she deserved to win or not. But we can look at it objectively to determine if it was reasonable by analyzing her charting and # streams then compare them to another top perfroming country artist this past year. Since she also won top album of the year let's compare her to other top artists as well. \n\nFirst let's look at billboard ratings, which counts how many times a week an album or single is played and charts them on the top 100 or 200 weekly. And by quote \"Chart positions are based on multi-metric consumption, blending traditional album sales, track equivalent albums, and streaming equivalent albums.\" \n\nSo how often did beyonce chart for top country album? 4 times, 3 in April and once in May. How about charts for top album of 2024? 2 times, 2 in April. \n\n To compare the most listened country album of 2024 was Morgan Wallen with \"one thing at a time\" charting most frequently with a total of 34 times between December 2023 and January 2025. \n\nTo also compare for top album of 2024 is taylor swift with \"tortured poets department\" top charting 17 times. \n\nSo she clearly didn't win by frequency of top charting in either catagory. \n\nWhat about total number of media consumption like streams? Let's look at spotify for this, She got About 1.6 billion streams in total for \"cow boy carter\".\n\nHow does she compare to Morgan Wallen? His album \"one thing at a time\" amassed 6.5 billion streams on spotify.\n\nHow about biliie eilish? \"Hit me hard and soft\" amassed 5.6 billion streams on spotify. \n\nAnd taylor swift? \"5 billion streams on spotify\n\nTherefore she doesn't even beat out anyone here by streams either. However, she did in technicality, place 2nd for top charting country album outperforming other artists within the charts and # streams.\n\nNow with all that being said, Morgan Wallen was not considered for a grammy this year because his album simply did not release within the required time period. Therefore Beyonce would've won the grammy for best country album this year anyways considering she outperformed other country artists.\n\nAs for top album of the year? What the hell was this outcome, definitely not deserved when looking at it objectively, and if this isn't proof of Grammys being fixed or biased, idk what is. Let's be clear, I did not like taylor swifts album because I'm not her target audience. but if I'm looking at it objectively, she could've won it. \n\nAnd Let's not forget billie eilish, She definely had a better shot at winning top album of the year opposed from beyonce based off streaming statistics. \n\nIn conclusion, I think she would've won top country album regardless of what anyone says solely basing on streams and charts (unless I'm proven otherwise by someone else). But top album? Come on people, get real, what do the grammys prove then? If the voting is entirely subjective then why do people watch it? \n\nNow to express myself and be subjective for the sake of it, In my honest opinion, I just didn't enjoy her album as much as I expected or quite frankly at all. I didn't find much of the songs catchy and felt like they missed the emotional mark much of beyonces previous top hit songs hold. And to be even more blunt, her album felt more like an attempt to \"represent\" black people in country music in order to \"break\" the system or something along those lines. Honestly, country isn't her style of genre, I applaud the attempt, but I feel like it might have performed better if it felt more like she was interested in the genre, than challenging it and inserting herself in it for the sake of racial demographics. To go deeper, articles about the album glaze over the fact that she's a \"woman of color attempting to break into country music\". In my opinion who gives a shit, that shouldn't be a selling point for anything. Black people and quite frankly any other race can thrive in any genre without having to glaze over their \"identity\" and \"demographics\". In my opinion, to even factor race and sex in an non-athletic form of competition is just disgusting and literally the definition of sexism and racism. \n\nTo compare to her best work \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\",  which IMO is a fantastic album rooted with emotion and excellent writing, with songs written about relationships from a female perspective, ultimately proves her ability to legitimately win a grammy and produce fantastic songs. The only song I could sit and listen to without immidiately changing the song from \"Cowboy Carter\" was \"Levi's jeans\" which, I personally didn't find amusing enough to intentionally put it on repeat or on my playlists.\n\nAnd before anyone starts commenting, yes I listened to the entirety of the album, and yes I do occasionally listen to country music. I just didn't like it that much for the aforementioned reasons. I am not a racist and much of the music I listen to comes from African American people. But i don't listen to their music just because they are black, I listen to it because it's enjoyable. I feel alot of people might have a bias to glazing her album because she is a \"woman and black\" which yenno what, that's fine, all the power to ya. But for an award to be bestowed with no statistics to justify it? That's wild to me. \n\n And if we factor all of what i said in it just seems like she got the top album of the year grammy for just being of a woman of color attempting another swing at country opossed from statistical performance. Which is just wrong, Beyonce does have the following and skills to outperform her competitors, but she did not stick to her roots which in my opinion, resulted in her win for top album being controversial and a bit insulting. In my opinion billie eilish or taylor swift deserved the win.\n\nI hope I don't get blasted for speaking my mind, all here for discussion :)",
    "Nah, Beyonce's album had maybe one good original song on it, and it wasn't that one they played way too much.  I personally thought Billie Eilish's album was much better.\n\n#",
    "The point that you're missing is this album wasn't at all worthy, it was an okay-ish album at best. Albums like the midwest princess or brat should've won which shows more diversity and is damn good\u00a0",
    "you lost me at \u201cwoman of color\u201d people hate on her 1. bc of the meme that everyone is scared of her and her possible ties to diddy 2. i think it\u2019s fair to day the album doesn\u2019t sound country 3. she has so many already and it feels fair to give the chance to other artists 4. last year jay z had a meltdown over not winning (for once) most of the time you are the one nominating yourself. nothing to do w her skin color.",
    "Listen, I love Beyonce (though I've not been a fan of her recent work but I know she's talented and forever one of the greats) but all I ever saw online about Cowboy Carter was that people weren't a fan. Did I feel like it was unfair criticism at times? Yes. But Cowboy Carter and it's singles weren't widespread favorites and they weren't everywhere either. It was easier not to have heard any of the songs if you weren't listening to the radio. On the other hand, I would say that Billie Eilish's songs were everywhere, on the radio, in stores, used in a movie commercial, etc and for a long time after the album was released. It was also a widespread favorite, even among people who weren't Billie fans. \n\nI think Beyonce should've won AOFY at least once in her career but not for this album. The Grammys trying to backpedal and give her this award because they feel regretful over not awarding it to her in the past, is just unfair to the artists who were in the category this year. Create a category for the outliers who didn't get awards when they shouldve, for iconic, culturally significant albums for cases like this so that Beyonce's previous snubs can be corrected but this ain't it. I was honestly surprised by this result and I'm surprised there isn't more push back about it.\n\nNow the country album, idk about that one. Idk if it played differently in the country scene but I kind of doubt it. But I can give that a pass, versus AOTY because to me, AOTY surpasses any genre constraints and I don't think she did that. I actually thought this was probably her most under performing album and I felt support for her was falling off.",
    "If this instance doesn't show you that these awards shows are fixed then I don't know what will.\n\nCowboy Carter received 0 (zero) nominations for the CMAs, yet she wins album of the year???? You think someone(s) in the voting section of the grammy's was trying to correct the \"wrong\"???",
    "i just dont understand how impact she is with country album? which i dont know how many song i from her that i hear last year which is only \\*this aint texas shit,if anything about country that deserve might aswell i put post malone album that he made more impactfull with all the featuring country artist. facepalm of the year for this award",
    "Well she couldn't make it in pop rock whatever category so she went country and now they're feeling obligated to have her win. Wow the whole thing is a sham. I don't think she's that talented either. And I thought the rules for each category was that the music had to be at least 50% country or whatever can you really say all her stuff was country?",
    "I'm not a fan of Beyonce. I think she always seems to be the \"center of attention\" and doesn't know how to blend in. I think her trauma with the paparazzi and the public seems to close her off to her fans, and maybe that's necessary. She has some great songs, but even II Most Wanted sounds wrong for me because Beyonce doesn't balance out Miley. However, I can never seem to escape her music nor her vocals. She's a fantastic singer and has written and performed some amazing, some catchy, and some emotional songs. Beyonce is not Beyonce without her voice.\n\nWith that being said, this was not the album that deserved to win, but I believe the album that was necessary to win. This album for Beyonce feels like she let AI do her homework based on what criteria she wanted and her previous work. Her songs are catchy, and that's cool and all, but when you've been listening to someone for literal decades, you can sense a familiarity in their music. This music doesn't feel like Beyonce. Her last 4 albums sounded like her; different sound, still her. This is \"someone took Beyonces actual country album, tried to replicate it, failed, filled in the missing gaps and then said 'I promise this is Beyonces album\" This award feels like a pity award for neglecting her previous work, and because they got called out. It makes it even more obvious that attention needs to be brought to their nomination and awarding processes. \n\nAccording to Statista, women aren't even nominated for the album of the year as much as men are. \"Between the years of 2013 and 2024, 14.7 percent of artists nominated for Grammy awards were female, and 85.3 percent were male.\" This has been in the media since 2016, but this is the first year they are addressing it.\n\nIf we want to truly be able to criticize the fairness of whether someone \"deserves\" an award, then the Grammys need to be more transparent about their criteria for nomination and awards. Otherwise, we keep falling into this trap of \"did they actually deserve to win.\"\n\n\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/801372/gender-grammy-nominees/#:~:text=Gender%20distribution%20of%20Grammy%20nominees%20in%20the%20U.S.%202013%2D2024&text=Between%20the%20years%20of%202013,gender%20distribution%20in%20the%20industry.",

I'll admit I didn't listen to the whole album, but I listened to Texas Hold Em (And that was because it went viral so I listened to it a few times) And I liked it and it's still very catchy, but something about it just didn't feel authentic. To me it just felt stereotypical, like most country music I've listened to doesn't just throw every single thing country related into a song. To me it isn't about color, and I think she's an amazing artist. And I'm still young so I don't know completely about the grammys, I just wanted to voice my opinion.",

The genre only gained popularity with the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers, both of which were of traditionally \"white\" origins (Jimmie Rodger's family was from Ireland.)\n> This was well deserved and shows her impact on country music.\n\nExplain her impact on country music. How did Beyonce change the genre with this album?\n>People are also not understanding how big of a deal it is that she won album of the year. She\u2019s been working for over 20 years and she has more than 30 grammys and not one of them is an album of the year.\n\nAlbum of the year is not determined by how long an artist has been performing, but by how popular their music is amongst her fan and in the genre itself.\n> Billie is only 23 and has so many Grammys, I can guarantee that she will have another shot at album of the year in the near future. (mind you she already has won all of the year) \n\nThis is a good point and goes more to show how popular Billie Eilish is compared to Beyonce. \n> I honestly think people are so quick to dismiss Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s career and achievements just because she\u2019s a woman of color. \n\nI give this paper an F\n\n1. Didn't properly discuss the topic\n2. Didn't properly justify the win\n3. Didn't compare or contrast Beyonce against the other artists she won against\n4. Didn't explain how Beyonce impacted country music; Show, don't tell.\n5. Doesn't properly attribute the AOTY. Album of the year isn't earned because one has experience. It's earned because people liked it.\n6. Improper association between Beyonce's age and her popularity. Age of the artist doesn't guarantee popularity.\n7. Didn't stay on topic. Brings race and politics into a discussion about music.\n\nIn short, Beyonce didn't deserve Album of The Year because she's black. She deserved it because people liked it... which I'm not seeing evidence that they did. This was an undeserved win. This is why people are being terrible to her. She stole someone else's AOTY.\n\nEdit: Also before anyone tries to bring race into my comment, I'm American Indian. Which begs the questions, when are more AI artists going to gain national recognition and popularity and start winning Grammys?",
    "Because Its 100% based whatever reason of the judges opinion of artists who are on popular labels for whatever reason the judges choose.\n\nIf you every heard someone say \"Music business\" its exactly like a business. Their product is the artist, just like Apple sells iMac.",
    "The only reason she flipped over to country music is cuz she failed in every other genre of music. Even the country singers that have been in the country music industry for decades do not consider her a country singer. Her husband bought her Grammy and all the whining and bitching and complaining that she didn't win all the other times yeah she didn't win.",
    "Here's the reason why I think it's good. Just because an album has good intentions like Beyonce's does not actually make it a good album. I, unlike most, have listened to it. It is trash. It is unlistenable. 2/10 album. I do not want to listen to it ever again. When I listened to it, I was actually going in thinking it would be good, since that is what I heard at the time. I was mistaken. I think it is simultaneously this and the fact that this year was such a HUGE year for music with so many amazing albums and releases that explains why people are so upset. To be honest, I think literally every other artists who was nominated deserves the grammy more than her. Also, to put it lightly, Beyonc\u00e9 is overrated in general. She is a great artist, don't get me wrong, but she has the most grammies. She absolutely does not deserve that title. Also, \"Queen of pop\" is kinda crazy considering there are MANY other pop artists who are better than her. I think people are just fed up with Beyonc\u00e9 being dick-rode to no end and how she is held as some Golden standard when she hasn't made good music in years. Respectfully. I know her cultural impact has been huge and great, but the music is all that should matter in the grammies, and her music is FINE.",
    "What's amazing how people who listen to the likes of Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Blake Shelton, George Strait, Reba, Dolly, Alan Jackson, the late Tim McGraw, Brooks & Dunn, the late Charley Pride, Rascally Flatts, Lady Antebellum, Barbara Mandrell, have NEVER heard Beyonce's air play on the likes of Dallas' 99.5 The Wolf... I guess she'll be voted as an outstanding pious woman and influencer in Christian circles next...",
    "I loved the reasoning and logic behind this argument all the way until the end. Loved how you reasoned that Beyonce's album was 2nd top charting country album, which is why she probably did deserve to win that one but I can see argument being made for why she didn't deserve it so also all is fair. But your last few paragraphs that's where you lost me. Maybe you're right maybe  people love Beyonce for being black and a women but can't the same argument then be made for Taylor Swifts grammy wins except exchange black for white. That her being a white women is why she does so well with an award ceremony that hadn't awarded a black women album of the year in the last 27 years until this past Sunday. Maybe we can do that with Adele too seeing how the common listeners thought when Adele won and even Adele to my understanding of that night, everyone thought that was the actual year Beyonce deserved AOTY and not her. \n\nI think she unrightfully got it after complaining for years about how she was snubbed and to be fair in my opinion, some of those years she was. With her husband last year complaining at the previous grammys about how beyonce never won aoty even though she then and still now has the most grammys awards of any artist or group of all time played a factor and made it look a certain way. Do I think Billie Ellish should have won yes, do I think Beyonce won because she's black hell no because if that was the case she would have won album of the year already. And to just hit home the fact that it's not because she was a black woman performing country to break into it or represent for black people...there have been plenty of times in recent history where country music  (CMA's) doesn't award or recognize black artist even when they have number 1 charting hits arguably the biggest country songs over their respective years, being Shaboozey and Lil Nas X. Shaboozey also didn't win any grammys so again I think if we're talking race that argument falls flat. Even with the intersectionality aspect I'm just not convinced. Not including that fact that only 3 black people have ever won period at the CMA's being black and doing country music is clearly not an advantage to anyone, including Beyonce.",
    "Agreed with every one of your points!!! Well said",
    "You reasoning is based off criteria that Grammy doesn\u2019t use. If that was the case, she would have beat Beck in 2015. It\u2019s based off artistic excellence and they mention that over and over that night. She may not of had the highest streams but her album was rated higher than Billie and Taylor\u2019s on every outlet from Metacritic\n to billboard. Billie lost every category, she was never going to win AOTY. She lost to Charli, Sabrina, and Kendrick, 6 noms by 4 people before the last category was even called. Artistically Cowboy Carter was a bit more loaded than hmhas was. In rare cases they choose talent over popularity. Like Beck over Beyonce and Beyonce over Billie.",
    "SO, Beyonc\u00e9's new album, just like her last one, has her dipping her toes into a genre that's not really her usual thing. The previous was dance music.\u00a0 And, yeah, the album's great and dominated the charts. But, honestly, I'm starting to think it's less about her genuinely wanting to explore these new sounds and more about just... knowing she can conquer anything she tries.\u00a0\u00a0\nLike, she's got such a massive fanbase that she's basically guaranteed to win, no matter what genre she tackles.\nIt almost feels like she's going into these genres just to prove a point",
    "This was a fascinating comment! Thanks for breaking down the metrics.",
    "First of all, your claim that Beyonce only got the top album of the year simply because she's black is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. She won because it's actually a pretty damn good album, and it's completely different from anything she's ever done before. That's why it hit the top of the country charts, even if the country gatekeepers refused to recognize the fact that she was even on the charts.\n\nWhat you don't understand, and refused to even acknowledge, is how country music has deliberately kept black artists shut out of the genre for decades---that's just flat-out racism right there. It's only been in the last decade that black artists have started to make any real headway in country music----such as Mickey Guyton, Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, The War & Treaty, Miko Marks, Alice Russell, Brittany Spencer, Breland, and others. Both Guyton and Rucker have been open in the last few years how difficult it was for them to even get into the country genre, and the racism they're had to deal with along the way, just for being black artists in that genre.\n\nThis claim that Beyonce should \"stick to her roots\" is a bunch of nonsense, too. She switched up genres because she got tired just sticking to her roots, and singing the same kind of music she's been singing for years. That's what most artists do----they like switching things up from time to time, to keep themselves sounding fresh. I've noticed that white artists get to do this all the time--hop from genre to genre, but black artists are only supposed to stick to singing R&B, gospel, jazz, and hip-hop, as if that's all they can sing or perform. It's an insult to black people to think that's all we're supposed to sing, and it's a bunch of BS.\n\nBeyonce literally grew up Texas, where so many country singers come from---that it's not even weird that she should actually be into it. The country music genre has been too lily-white, and too conservative, racist and stuck-in-the-mud for damn near a century know---and that's way too damn long. The country gatekeepers still act like it's the 1950s or something. White people do not have a claim on country music---that is, they are not the only ones who can play it, sing it, or write it, or even like it. Yet the white country gatekeepers still act like nobody who isn't white can't claim country music as their own. Screw that outdated, outmoded BS.\n\nThe fact that Beyonce hit the top of the country charts is proof that even white people don't mind listening to country music that isn't sung by a white person for a change, and that even they're tired of the same old same old whatever in country music. . That's being said, I'm glad she won, because she deserved to win. She didn't take a damn thing from Billie Ellish or Taylor Swift, who are allowed to sing whatever the hell they want, like most white artists do. Funny how no one mentions the Swift started out as a country artist herself, and how many white pop singers have had hits on the country charts over decades. Yet a black artist like Beyonce tries to do the same thing, and some white folks who like country act like the sky caved in, just because she did. It's so damn ridiculous. If she was white, we wouldn't even be discussing this.",
    "i mean one of her albums literally changed the charting schedule for the whole music industry  so yeah she's pretty big lol",
    "The CMAs would be broadcasted in white hoods and burning crosses on stage before they give an award to a black person",
    "why are we not talking about the fact that the Grammys were fixed back in 2016 when she was supposed to win for album of the year and it was given to Adele? It was the most critically acclaimed album and the most successful, YET given to another artist? It\u2019s the same reasoning everyone is having for Billie, 2016 was a SNUB. If they cannot put their own likes aside and understand that Lemonade was a FANTASTIC album, then people are blinded. It\u2019s the same reasoning that everyone is having for Billie Eilish.",
    "Um, she spent five years making this album, she didn't just throw it out there, and the fact that it hit number one on the country charts means that she did earn it. She didn't go to the country station to promote because, to be frank, there was such a hateful backlash about her even having played at the CMAs in 2016, even thought she was invited to play there by the Dixie Chicks (they just call themselves the Chicks now) to do a song with them. She got a lot of hate simply for showing up there, which was so damn ridiculous, and hell yes, it was all about her being black. You just refuse to admit that racism has anything to with why there was such hate thrown at her from the CMA audience.  Explain to me exactly what Post Malone and Jelly Roll did to earn being country singers, even though neither one did anything like country before last year. What exactly is your definition of what one must do to be considered country, anyway? \n\nOh, and Beyonce didn't have to use her clout to get anything. The point being, I've never heard of a artist who was nominated 32 times, but never won anything. I can't even think of a single white artist that's happened to. She earned it, just like most artists who get Grammy noms or wins have. Clout alone does not get you a Grammy. As usual, none of you trolls know what you're talking about on this subject.",
    "Lainey Wilson is actually a pretty good singer, but let's be real-----most of these country singers--who are mostly white, of course---start to all sound alike after awhile, and look alike. There's really nothing original or new about the way most of them currently sing. It's like they all have to stick to what an image of a country singer is, and never go beyond that. Which is why country has become so conservative and boring. Which is also why these new black country artists coming up are putting some fresh blood into it, even if the country gatekeepers themselves won't admit that. Country needs to change just like any other musical genre, or grow stale as hell----it can't just keep being stuck in the past forever. That goes for any other musical genre, but country just seems more stuck in a rut, and not wanting to move forward---as if its gatekeepers want to stay stuck in the '50s or something.\n\nAnd it's been nice to see more black country singers coming up, because their mere presence is challenging this old racist idea that country can only be an-all white space, which it's been for way too many decades, and why the hell that is still even the case. That old racist idea that country music is only for white people, when both black and white people started out playing and singing country music together in the mid-1800s, only started in the 1920s, when white guys in the music biz trying to market certain types of music decided that country music--i.e. white people singing and playing guitars--would only be marketed to white folks, while black folks playing guitars would be marketed to them separate as \"the blues\". And it's been that ever since. This is the 21st century----this old, tired-ass racist, completely out of date idea that country is only for white people needs to stop, and be buried somewhere.",
    "Why wasn\u2019t Cowboy Carter a good album? Nobody has provided a valid reason for why the album \u201cwasn\u2019t good\u201d. Also that\u2019s a stupid comparison. If Taylor Swift MADE an r&b album then she would be nominated. The category is best country album, not artist. Cowboy Carter was a country album through and through so that\u2019s not a valid reason at all for why she shouldn\u2019t have been nominated.",
    "Beyonce didn't steal a damn thing from anybody---that's a bunch of stupid nonsense---her gain is not somebody's else damn loss, so get off that. She made a damn good country album, which nobody expected, and finally got a long overdue award for it. It went to the top of the country charts, meaning that enough people liked it to get it up there in the first place. It's made an impact because she also used it as an opportunity to showcase some new and upcoming black country singers, and to show and prove that country music is no longer just a \"white thing\", or something only for white people any more.\n\nAnd your claims that country music is lily-white just goes to show that you don't know jack about black Americans' contribution to country music. Hell, the banjo itself is an instrument that was invented in Africa by Africans in the 18th century or so. These articles show that black American musicians had far more of an influence on some of the first white country singers than they were ever given credit for, and that both black and white musician play what would come to be called \"country music\" until it got segregated for marketing reasons in the 1920s, and the contributions of black country musicians got completely whitewashed out of country music history, and brushed aside, ignored, and forgotten in order to sell country music as a \"whites-only\" musical invention, which it never was to begin with:\n\n[Black Artists Helped Build Country Music, Then It Left Them Behind](https://time.com/5673476/ken-burns-country-music-black-artists/)\n\n[A Dive Into The Black History of Country Music: Giving Credit Where It's Due](http://skidmorenews.com/new-blog/2022/2/23/a-dive-into-the-black-history-of-country-music-giving-credit-where-its-due)\n\n[Country Music Has A Problem: It's Not Beyonce](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/3/5/beyonce-tops-country-charts-first-black-woman-history/)\n\n[The Black Origins of Country Music](https://jaxmusic.org/jme/2022/06/the-black-origins-of-country-music/)\n\n[Not Their First Rodeo: Black Musicians And The Birth Of Country Music](https://hnoc.org/publishing/first-draft/not-their-first-rodeo)",

    "You spent a lot of time writing this. And I appreciate your dedication to Beyonce. Im sure it helps you feel better about calling certain people racist. But,,,,I said what I said. Read alllll the other comments on this thread. Look on social media in general. You are one of very very few people who thinks this album is Grammy worthy. Not with the other albums that were presented. \n\nYes. There are racist people. Is the majority of the population racist? Not likely. This album had no business winning against artists like Lainey Wilson, or Chris Stapleton. It was bought. And let\u2019s be real. Billie Eilish had a better album. The majority of the nominees did? Did YOU listen to the other artists albums? Cuz I have. Most of them. If you were honest, you would listen, then re-evaluate your thoughts. But you are going to say all those artists are white. Meaning they don\u2019t deserve to win, and if they did, it\u2019s because \u201cracism\u201d. \n\nVery few people think Bey deserved it. I\u2019m a fan of hers. I own Cowboy Carter among some of her other work. And I understand and comprehend that just because she made an album outside her normal genre, it DOES NOT MEAN she deserves these accolades. The album simply wasn\u2019t as good as the others. Period!!!! Morgen Wallen got his first Grammy nomination with Post Malone this year. His first. Such a joke. Do you know who Morgan Wallen is? Have you listened to his music?? It crushes most of the country albums out there,,,,,,and yet the Grammys never nominated him. Till this year with Post. Why is that? It\u2019s odd to me. It\u2019s odd to me that Cowboy Carter beat out a huge country artist that has arguably one of the most unique voices:Chris Stapleton. We could call this racist. Cuz I\u2019m telling you, and you should hear this: It isn\u2019t only white people who are racist. The way it sounds,,,,,is that YOU are the one who determines who should receive accolades based on color. Not achievements. \n\nEveryone who is country knows that the CMT\u2019s are the serious country awards. They arent having it, hun. Maybe part of it is Beyonces boo-hoo attitude of, \u201cThey don\u2019t like me, they must be racist.\u201d Her husband whining and crying last year. Give me a break. She  just EXPECTED to win.

    "Here's some good recent books about black folks' contributions to country music:\n\nMy Black Country: A Journey Through Country Music's Black Past, Present and Future, by Alice Randall---the author writes about her love of country music, and what it was like being one of the few black country songwriters in Nashville in the early '80s, and the racism she had to deal with at the time.\n\nBlack Country Music: Listening For Revolutions by Francesca T. Royster---this book is about the author's love of country music as a queer black woman, and what it's like being a black country music fan.\n\nDeFord Bailey: A Black Star In Early Country Music, By David C. Morton---this is the first book I've ever heard of written about Bailey, the first black country musician to play at the very first Grand Ole Opry, and who is credited with introducing the harmonica to the genre.\n\nCountry Soul: Making Music and Making Race In The American South, by Charles L. Hughes. This book goes into detail about how black country musicians' influence on their white contemporaries rarely translated into them getting any support for making their own country albums, or even trying to make a career out of it because of the racism in the country music biz.\n\n\n\nHidden In The Mix: The African-American Presence In Country Music, edited by Diane Pecknold. This is an interesting anthology of essays about black folks in the country music genre.\n\n\n\nThere was also another book called From Where I Stand: The Black Experience In Country Music, but it appears to be out of print. There was also a 3-CD box set with that same title that came out back in 1998, featuring the work of black country artists I'd never heard of at the time---I'm guessing the book was a companion to it. That same CD box set has been updated as of last year with a fourth CD, featuring a new collection of black country artists that have arrived since 2000. Here's an article about that:\n\n[Country Music Hall of Fame Spotlights Black Country Artists With Expanded Version of \"From Where I Stand\"](https://www.billboard.com/music/country/from-where-i-stand-set-expanded-set-country-music-hall-of-fame-1235697619/)",

    "First of all, I write a lot about subjects and things I like, just like anyone else on these boards. I'm not and have never been a part of the \"Beyhive\". I'm simply someone who liked Destiny's Child when they first came out, and thought all three of the ladies in the group could sing, and followed what each of them have done songwise since. Second of all, you're just mad that she won, and that your favorite artists didn't. Come on now----Beyonce winning is not taking a damn thing away from either Ellish or Morgan---everybody already knows who they are, and they're famous, too. So get over whining about them. The fact is, black artists have always been shut out of and ignored by the country music business, until recently, no matter how talented they were. That's just pure racism, pure and damn simple. Why else was Charley Pride the only black country artist they let slip in for decades? It darn sure as hell wasn't because they weren't any other equally talented black artists who wanted to sing country music. Also, how many white artists as talented as Beyonce do you know who have been nominated 32 times at the Grammys and still never actually won one? Can't think of one, can you? I thought not.\n\nThe thing is, white artists have always been allowed to jump into any genre they want, and still sell CDs, and win awards and prizes for them. Black artists are still expected to only sing gospel, R&B, or rap simply because they're black, told to stay in their lane, and not allowed to jump from genre to genre and experiment/mix things up---which is really ridiculous, in this day and age. Which is what Beyonce did, and some white folks who still have this outdated as hell racist idea that country music is only for white people to play and sing, are just so damn mad that she didn't go through the usual country music gatekeepers and just went straight to the top of the country charts without their permission.\n\nKeep in mind, Beyonce did go perform at the CMT's in 2016, to which she was invited, and she got such a nasty backlash from the audience there, that of course she never went back. The CMT even performed the gutless move of cutting her performance out of that special, which was even more pathetic. Basically a lot of white people just flat-out hated the fact that a black artist period was trying to sing country music at the CMT. It didn't matter that she came from the same state as a lot of country singers, and grew up listening to it and liking it, their attitude was that she had no business being there because she was black. I guarantee you if Taylor Swift (who started out as a country singer) had done the same exact thing as Beyonce, nobody would have a single damn problem with it, and you know that.\n\nYour opinion is just that--your opinion,period---you do not represent the \"majority of the population\" and it's really arrogant and laughable of you to think that you do. Once again, the fact that she went to the top of the country charts proves that she finally earned that Grammy. She's an artist who has always pushed and challenged herself to put out the best releases, when she could have just sat back, took it easy, and coasted on her back catalog.\n\nEven after over 25 years of being in the music biz, her music still sounds fresh, which isn't always the case with pop or R&B artists who have been around as long, or longer than she has. That's why I continue to listen to her music, because I appreciate artists who continue to push themselves musically. Your ridiculous claims that she only won because of her clout are so damn ridiculous. If she could use her clout to win, then how come it took her so long to get a Grammy? Your reasoning about that dosen't even make any damn sense when you really think about it. You're in complete denial about how racist the country music biz is and has always been. That why I posted those articles about country singers Mickey Guyton and Darius Rucker discussing how they're always had to deal with racism throughout their careers as black artists in the predominately white country music industry. Obviously you didn't even bother to read them. It's easy for white people to be denial about racism because they never have to deal with it at all, or just pretend that it dosen't exist, because it never affect them at all.\n\nAnd you keep claiming that Beyonce didn't \"earn\" her Grammy or the right to even be on the country charts---well, explain to me how Post Malone, a pop singer, and Jelly Roll, a former rapper \"earned\" the right to be on the country charts when neither one of them, like Beyonce, were even a part of the country music scene? Funny how nobody has a problem with either one of them switching to country music, even though they're not even traditionally \"country\". I find it interesting that when I asked that question in a previous post, you ignored it completely, and never bothered to even answer that question. Because you know good and damn well it's because they're white. If they were black, they would have never been accepted that quick into the country fold.\n\nAnd there have been plenty of white pop artists that have crossed over into the country charts, like Olivia Newton-John, Jewel, and plenty of others. Yet nobody ever whined about them being on there, and yet white artist still do that with no whines or complaints about them doing the same thing Beyonce has done. Nope, apparently it's only a problem when black artists do it. So stop trying to twists things around and acting as if the very bringing up of the existence of racism is racist---that's just straight-up stupid as hell, and it's always been a reality that black people have had to deal with. You're just pissed off that it's even brought up in the first place--you need to ask yourself why, instead of just whining about it because you didn't want to hear it.\n\nI guess you forgot that part of the Grammys where the head of the Grammy voting committee had to explain how there had been changes over the past few years---especially since there have been other black artists complaining over the years about how they feel that black artists didn't get enough recognition at the Grammys. Heck the Grammys didn't even acknowledge that hip-hop existed until the early '90s, when it had already been around for just over a decade.\n\nAnyway, Beyonce won, so get over and stop whining and complaining about it yourself. I'm still loving the fact that she finally won, and that she deserved it, lol. That isn't just my opinion, it's a damn fact, which is backed up by her having won in the first place.",
    "i sound ignorant for pointing out systemic racism and discrimination LOLLL?",
    "So basically\u2026 her team won, not her\u2026 cause I can almost promise you that Beyonc\u00e9 isn\u2019t the reason that album has \u201cquality\u201d if we\u2019re talking sonically. I seriously don\u2019t understand how she won.. and I haven\u2019t even listened to the album. BECAUSE I DIDNT EVEN HEAR ABOUT IT.

Why exactly is it \u201cshit\u201d. Music is purely subjective to the listener and generalizing every song she has ever made makes no sense. She has made hits for years and no two songs sound the same, so how can you say \u201call her tracks are shit\u201d. Kanye got kicked out of the Grammys right after he got there, so stop trying to find some sort of association there. Beyonc\u00e9 made a great album that reclaims the genre, and that is undeniable.",

But when the majority of people think she SHOULD NOT have gotten those awards,,,,you have to ask why? And YOU are saying racism plays into that. Perhaps her album just wasn\u2019t that great. People are voicing that opinion. That other albums are better and did better. It\u2019s obvious her clout got her those awards. It\u2019s fine if you are a fan of hers.

    "Uh, no-----it's because for the longest time country music pretty much ignored black country artists and never accepted them. Yeah, they let Charley Pride in the door, but that's mainly because he was selling a lot of records, and didn't rock the boat, so to speak. And it was the usual case of, they had their one black person, and that was all they needed. \n\nI used to like some country songs as a child, but as I grew up, it became harder to really like country as a whole when I never saw any country artists who looked like me, and there's the fact that country music itself was always associated with racist rednecks who hated black folks, and deliberately shut them out of the country music business for years--making it seem like country music was exclusively for white people and white people only---which it was, for a long as hell while, and for too damn long, to be honest. \n\nMore black country artists have been coming up in the last decade, which has been great to see, and aren't keeping quiet about how ingrained the racism in the country music business really is toward black artists even today. Heck, in the last decade the country music gatekeepers have been accused of not even giving female country artists enough play on radio station, and prioritizing male country singers over them. Talk about going backwards. \n\nHere's an interview with country singer/songwriter Frankie Staton, who started the Black Country Music Association back in the '90s, along with singer Cleve Francis, as a platform to help black country musicians get a foothold into the business, and what a difficult struggle it was, since Nashville pretty much ignored them,and had no interest in pushing black country singers at all, no matter how talented they were, she said. Which is why the BCMA only lasted barely a decade. There's a Rolling Stone article from a few years back that goes into more depth about them, but Staton talks about managing to carve out a space in country music as a songwriter, dealing with yep, racism, even just for trying to be a songwriter, and the impact Beyonce's Cowboy Carter has had on country music for black country musicians in the article from last year:\n\n[Frankie Staton On Building a Future For Black Country Musicians](https://floodmagazine.com/154727/frankie-staton-feature/)",
    "music is subjective and beyonc\u00e9 won for best album for a reason. her album tells a story and is a compilation of songs that come together to form a narrative. i stand by the fact that it was deserved and that she has been snubbed in the past due to racism. the academy also doesn\u2019t go based on whether the song is \u201cgood\u201d or not it\u2019s also about the artist\u2019s accomplishments on the charts, how the album comes together, and whether the music has true quality or not. beyonc\u00e9 has dealt with racism in the past and she continues to as well. i want you to go take a look at twitter and see some of the racist shit people HAVE actually posted after her wins. not all the haters are racist, but there is no denying that racism has played a major part in the hate she has gotten throughout the years and also the discrimination she has faced in the industry. no one else is getting as much hate as beyonc\u00e9 after the grammy\u2019s even though so many other artists also beat out billie eilish and others.",
    "I don\u2019t feel like she \u201creclaimed\u201d anything. She essentially made a pop album with some country typical instruments, threw some big name country legends on it and called it a day. If anything, she took away from black female artists that are true country artists. They are the ones we should be recognizing. Not someone who has been famous for the last 20 years, and is making the switch because country is cool right now.",
    "All that\u2019s being said, is that her awards were bought. You are defending the win\u2026and that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m black, and have walked this planet much longer than you. I\u2019ve experienced racism. And I\u2019m very aware of our history. But, when I commented my opinion, your FIRST response to me is, \u201cAre you white?\u201d\n\nYou basically lost credibility when you asked that. Why? Because you asked that, and were fully prepared to lecture me about oppression because you thought I was white. \n\nThis is why I\u2019m telling you to just stop. Please, stand up for our rights as black people, but don\u2019t boo hoo and make it sound like Beyonce is struggling through horrible oppression. Or that racism is the primary reason she is getting this hate.\n\nHer husband threw an embarrassing fit last year, and this year she wins? You think it\u2019s all a coincidence?\n\nMoney and power can buy just about anything. That\u2019s what occurred. And as much as you want to say Cowboy Carter told a story or whatever,,,,,it shouldn\u2019t have been the winner.\n\nBut it was. And we will all move on. But just know, that very few people think she deserved it. Not because of her color, but because the content of her album was not that great. Not at all.  Beyonce will live the rest of her life under the shadow of this award. Because, although her and Jay think they earned it\u2026.few others think she did.",
    "In 2016 when she performed her county song, Daddy lessons from her album lemonade at the CMAs with the chicks and she felt not welcome but she still decided to summit the the song for best country song at the Grammys but they told her that it wasn\u2019t eligible. So she went to work and worked on two albums, which are now act one Renaissance and act to Cowboy Carter, but the thing is Cowboy Carter was supposed to be at Act One and Renaissance supposed to be Act Two but because of the pandemic, she felt that it would\u2019ve been best to release Renaissance first to lifted people up and it\u2019s true because her last track on Cowboy Carter transitions into the first track on Renaissance.\n\nSo when was time to release act two she already did the work, the proof is in the album. Not only that had three country legends: Linda Martell, Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson she also brought on five young black country artist: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy, Reyna Roberts and Shaboozey who\u2019s music  numbers boosted after the release, especially Shaboozey who\u2019s song, A Bar Song(Tipsy) just entered its 27th week surpassing the weekends, blinding lights. Beyonc\u00e9 was also promoting the girls, especially putting their names on billboards. Wow promoting the album which all of them said, help them gain new fans. \n\nAnd because of her album of the year win they just won their first Grammy. And she dedicated her win to Linda Martell.\n\nThe album is very thought out with from the instruments being played by Stevie Wonder harmonica, Paul McCartney and Nile Rodgers on guitar and Rhiannon Giddens on the Banjo to the fact that each song is it own reimagined version of a western film.  \n\nThe album is predominantly country with a blend of Americana, pop, blues, folk, classic rock, hip hop and R&B and because of her Texan roots she also blended in zydeco, rock and roll, psychedelic soul, rhythm and blues, funk, gospel, bluegrass, opera, rock, honky-tonk and go-go. And also international musical elements as well like Flamenco, funk Carioca and Irish folk. Hence her saying this is an a country album. It\u2019s a Beyonc\u00e9 album and on track 12, Linda Martell says the line \u201cgenres is a funny little concept\u201d and on track 19 saying \u201c this particular tone stretches across arrange a genres and that what makes it a unique listen\u201d \n\nSo don\u2019t act like she just woke up one day and wanted to do a country album without knowing the history, there\u2019s a woman putting in the work and credit everyone that was involved with the album and that including the songwriters and producers of songs that she sampled for the album. This is the same woman that credit her husband on a song for just clapping.",
    "I found the comment that expressed exactly how I felt; word for word.\n\nIt would have been a better move to include people she felt were being ignored in country music so she could boost them as well as herself and find some credibility on the way. Instead it feels like she's reaching for credibility by including all these big names in country which kind of makes the album feel nepo. This also does kind of feel like a revenge album, and does feel a little forced because it still feels like a pop album with country elements. And it's not like Taylor Swift hasn't done the same, but Beyonce is supposed to be a leader, not a follower.\n\nBut on the other side, the album in and of itself is a statement, and that's enough for me. If this doesn't prove that the grammys is rigged and that she should have won before, and that it's a pity award for messing up, I don't know what would.",
    "there\u2019s no way of knowing if she bought the awards or not. idc if i lost credibility this is reddit not a dissertation \ud83d\udc80. she still has faced discrimination and i stand by that. ignoring that discrimination creates a narrative that her career has been a breeze, which it hasn\u2019t. her awards are deserved, she is genuinely the best vocalist of this generation and i stand by that as well. agree to disagree i guess. just because i\u2019m young doesn\u2019t mean i don\u2019t understand how society and the world works. i still stand by everything i hv said and if you disagree that\u2019s fine, beyonc\u00e9 stays winning and that\u2019s a fact.",

    "I agree with you completely.  With that said, I was stunned that Sierra Ferrell won 4 Grammys--because she was the artist who most captured my attention in 2024.

Art is subjective, there is no scientific measure of \"good.\" The very concept of \"quality\" is a matter of endless philosophical discussion. What *is* quality? \n\nI don't have a problem with artistic awards, but I think it quickly becomes a problem if people take it too seriously. I don't think it's possible to define something like art with rational language, which makes the whole thing kinda silly.

Trolling the Grammys is not an act of a sexual predator, whether a man or woman is doing it, and I doubt Kanye West, or even just an average joe streaker, would be facing a lifetime on the sex offender registry for doing it.

    "He probably won because He's a Man, woman.",
    "They also won Best Remixed Recording in 2009 (Electric Feel)",
    "Well, the title of the post doesn't say that either. It just says \"Tame Impala Wins First-Ever Grammy Award\" which is true.\n\nIf you click on the actual news, it states further information: *Tame Impala and Justice won Best Dance/Electronic Recording for their song \"Neverender\"*",
    "It\u2019s funny to see some of the nominees that lost that category and went on to be massive artists. At the same time, I don\u2019t think it should be a popularity contest, but that\u2019s pretty much what the Grammys are anyway, especially now. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance we\u2019ll ever get an underdog AOTY winner again with how rabid and fanatic people are these days.",
    "Oh yeah forgot about that, I think that was also MGMT\u2019s only Grammy win",
    "There will always be someone who just recently finds out that it\u2019s just one person and that\u2019s what keeps the meme funny to me lmao",
    "Okay yeah that's pretty understandable- I keep forgetting that the whole show genuinely takes like 6 hours"
