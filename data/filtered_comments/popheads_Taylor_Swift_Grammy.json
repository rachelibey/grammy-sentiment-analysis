    "There was just a thread created yesterday saying Taylor\u2019s music is consumed by only white girls. Haha\nThe Tortured poets department opened with 100M streams in China alone in one week.\nAlso, Taylor Swift was the only female as well as non Chinese artist in top 10 of China last year and she was 2nd.\nAnd as an international fan of Taylor, I think USA is actually the only place where she has competition cause globally, those in USA with cultural impacts or GP lovers are all khia\u2019s \nIndian guy here.",
    "and haters still say only Taylor's fan listen to her. NO, Swifties only can't achieve #1 on GLOBAL, STREAMING, SALES and VINYL all at once. this proves the gp LISTENS to Taylor Swift.",
    "Surprisingly, not many kpop acts this year. Last year the top 10 of the sales chart was entirely kpop (with the exception of Taylor Swift). I wonder whether the sales dropped or the calculation methodology changed?",
    "Taylor's legendary status is assured. She is already in the same league with Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis, Madonna.",
    "Cowboy Carter is #18 on the albums chart so it's not too surprising. Beyonce made the top 20 at #18 too. This is the rest of the list btw:\n\n11 Ariana Grande\n\n12 Post Malone\n\n13 Morgan Wallen\n\n14 ENHYPEN\n\n15 Travis Scott\n\n16 Kanye West\n\n17 Lana Del Rey\n\n18 Beyonc\u00e9\n\n19 Linkin Park\n\n20 Bad Bunny\n\nI am surprised that Bad Bunny is \"this low\".",
    "I think Kendrick and Beyonce just made really good music this year. It's not a conspiracy. There's certainly industry politics but it's not like there's a movement to bring down Taylor or Drake. (Well, people definitely hate Drake right now but unless proof of the rumored crimes materializes it's not going to go anywhere)",
    "Beyonce\u2019s catalogue is inexistent, Numbers are terrible right and left. It\u2019s weird because songs like single ladies do very low numbers.",

(She\u2019s from Oklahoma but whatever)\n\n**camerinian** (9): genuinely quite sad that the current country music moment would fucking hate a song like this\n\n**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Classic song with great vocals from Reba but something I don't think people appreciate enough about the song in this day and age is what a statement it made when Bobbie Gentry originally released it in 1969... it touches on topics like poverty, welfare, sex work, which are still pretty taboo even today. I'd give it a 10 but Reba did a live version with Kelly Clarkson that kinda washed the recorded version for me.\n\n**lexiaredery** (9): We need more country rates because this is basically my only exposure to it and I miss it\n\n**Ayzrules** (8.5): this has a really nice melody!\n\n**icantlikeeveryone** (8.5): Wow.... I don't like country genre for 97% of the time, and this song didn't singlehandedly change my opinion, but she sounds very fabulous here, and I really like the melodies, it's so colorful!\n\n**emayzee** (8.2): honestly modern country has really warped my view of the genre bc the old stuff can be GOOD\n\n**slimboyfriend** (8.2): me in the billboard top songs of 2014 when I gave fancy an 8\n\n**apatel27** (8): American dream in a nutshell\n\n**FitzMarble** (8): that one coworker who randomly trauma dumps after a few days of working with them and you can\u2019t escape\n\n**implasdad** (8): good solid country music\n\n**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I wish all modern country songs could go as hard as this one\n\n**ricki** (8): im sorry this happened to fancy but at least we got this song form it\n\n**Runaway3212** (8): I\u2019m happy All Stars gives you another chance at some songs cause this song has grown on me a lot\n\n**seanderlust** (8): This is kind of Jukebox Hero-coded no I will not be explaining\n\n**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i lied to my mom that reba was a converted muslim so i could buy the reba full series dvd collection and showed her this album cover as proof\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (7.3): Who the hell names their daughter Fancy anyways?\n\n**Awkward\\_King** (7): im sorry this could've eaten as a lip-sync song fuck the as5 producers for not giving kennedy enough time to learn it (but if youre a texas queen you should already know it by heart kinda) and for not better rigging it for like kylie or ginger\n\n**buildingigloos** (7): It reminds me of the country songs that were popular in the 60s, like a story set to music. Also is this the Brooklyn 99 theme tune\n\n**frogaranaman** (7): \"I was born white trash\" omg finally a lyric this sub can relate to\n\n**mustwinfullgaming** (7): I really liked the verses of this one, but I'm ngl...the chorus let me down sadly. Still a good song though.\n\n**pbk** (7): i still don't think this song is mixed well but it's fun\n\n**qazz23** (7): good cover, like the bigger sound of the chorus\n\n**team\\_kockroach** (7): Maybe it doesn\u2019t need to be 5 minutes long, but I love the narrative of this song a lot.\n\n**vayyiqra** (7): Never realized the lyrics to this are bleak and about grim stuff like poverty\n\n## let her down\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (6): I\u2019m a big country music fan myself, but I never got the appeal of this song\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (5.5): it\u2019s no the Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, I\u2019ll tell you that for free\n\n**daftsone** (5): I wasn\u2019t let down, just not let up either\n\n**RandomHypnotica** (5): the only Reba song i care about is I'm a Survivor\n\n**undisclosedthroway** (4): I didn\u2019t choose to be this way but I just cannot stand country music\n\n**pheromenos** (3): yeah this is very far from my music taste\n\n## why are there so many songs about fancies? and what's on the other side?\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (9): \uac70\uae30 \ub108 I fancy you, \uc544\ubb34\ub098 \uc6d0\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544, Hey I love you (Love ya)\n\n**stealthamo** (9): Pretty good for not having Charli XCX on the hook.\n\n**welcome2thejam** (8): \"Mama, why is my sister's name Rose?\" \"Because your Pa loved roses\" \"Thanks Mama\" \"No problem Fancy by Iggy Azalea ft.

It makes me imagine myself dancing happily with a random stranger lol.\n\n**jirachi** (10): best song ever i cannot believe it\n\n**Nagisoid** (10): Hot Girl Anthems\n\n**pbk** (10): levels of pussy thought impossible\n\n**qazz23** (10): really like how she belts out that chorus\n\n**RainbowSherbet47** (10): I think I\u2019ve never heard a song capture the 80s sound as well as this holy shit\n\n**wathombe** (10): oh this is a bop\n\n**welcome2thejam** (10): When you look up the moon line on Genius for some reason it just links to a Google Image search of \"jessie ware pearls lyrics\"\n\n**NFLfreak98** (9.5): jessie don\u2019t miss\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (9.2): not the best tune on the record, but damn it\u2019s a tight record\n\n**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): It\u2019s weird because I had no problem giving both of the 2023 Sub Faves submissions 10\u2019s in their original rate, but in a meta rate context\u2026it\u2019s just different. I can\u2019t quite say that this matches up to Caroline\u2019s slay.\n\n**implasdad** (9): good voice\n\n**lexiaredery** (9): I was playing this album so much last summer I may have made my Mom a Jessie Ware fan\n\n**vayyiqra** (9): I will not say what I think the pearls really are\n\n**NervousLemon6670** (8.8): Yeah sure that's a good retro throwback I can dance to this\n\n**Poydoo** (8.5): bop\n\n**Stryxen** (8.5): I know you wanna go to the moon. But if you don't go you'll never get there \ud83e\uddd0\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb\n\n**uiscebeathaoir** (8.5): re exploring this album after having gotten hugely into classic disco is such a fun experience, I have so much more respect for this song. I will say though that while this is a gag, Begin Again would\u2019ve been THE gag\n\n**mustwinfullgaming** (8): I AM SHAKING IT AND THERE ARE NO PEARLS LEFT TO FALL OFF COME BACK MY PEARLS PLEASE I NEED YOU\n\n**Roxieloxie** (8): cute\n\n**Runaway3212** (8): Rose Gray should target this tea\n\n**seanderlust** (8): The album cover on the Spotify playlist is so right, this is a hot girl anthem\n\n**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): shes like bruno mars for 20-something white gay men\n\n**team\\_kockroach** (8): I think Begin Again should\u2019ve been chosen instead, but this is still an infectious jam that showcases Jessie\u2019s incredible talents.\n\n**TiltControls** (8): I used this as the trailer music for that rate cycle and now it's all I can think of when I hear those opening notes\n\n**WindysaStarStarStar** (8): wake up pearl! You\u2019re about to be shook down\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (7.9): Shake those pearls!!\n\n**jman457** (7.8): good disco throwback\n\n**marbIeIily** (7.6): Pearl, so confusing\n\n## tired\n\n**buildingigloos** (7): I was genuinely confused when cupid by fifty fifty wasn't playing at the start\n\n**Content\\_Love5312** (7): A perfectly fine disco song from an album that I revisit often.\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (7): Love Me Like You Do is not a hot girl anthem at all (this is a comment on the compilation from Spotify)\n\n**pheromenos** (7): dgaf about her\n\n**sarcasticsobs** (7): Disco, how groundbreaking\n\n**slimboyfriend** (6.4): she\u2019s cute but she\u2019s got NOTHING on Ooh La La\n\n**asadprofessorplum** (6): The way this song was in my 2023 Spotify Wrapped Top 5 but now it\u2019s kind of a skip\u2026\n\n**daftsone** (6): What a voice\n\n**darj** (6): the way \u201cLightning\u201d is my favorite song on this album I\u2019m the sole dumb bitch yearning for Jessie to return to 2013 blend of Disclosure-core and sophistipop\n\n**apatel27** (4): So sick of this sound now",
    "# Slumber Party Pop\n\n---\n\n**Overall Average**: 7.821 **// Average Controversy:** 2.221\n\n---\n\nbeeozan: at least it's always nice to know that no matter how bad our rate results are it won't be as bad as slumber party pop\n\ndiminutiveaurochs: I didn't do this rate at the time (nor catch the now-legendary reveal), so this section of the rate was full of pleasant surprises! I really enjoyed the bright, carefree production on all these tracks - really dreamy and easy to lose yourself in.\n\n---\n\n* \\#15: Chappell Roan - HOT TO GO! | 8.267 | 826.7\n* \\#25: Hemlocke Springs - Enknee1 | 8.121 | 812.1\n* \\#30: Hemlocke Springs - Girlfriend | 8.023 | 802.3\n* \\#55: Remi Wolf - Quiet on Set | 6.873 | 687.3\n\n---\n\n**welcome2thejam** (10.000): Bitch!!!\n\n**Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (9.650): lol the gift that keeps on giving! nice to revisit the hemlocke cuts to confirm that she did have it\n\n**innuendo\\_overdose** (9.250): thank you so much for giving me a quick Slumber Party Pop rundown without having to listen to any Baby Queen, love that so much <3\n\n**jirachi** (9.250): unnecessary remi massacre and the wrong chappell songs winning ou that's not...\n\n**Ghost-Quartet** (9.000): I think some people questioned my All Stars picks for this rate because they weren't the obvious frontrunners and I think that's totally fair, but also their absence meant they got voted in and now Slumber Party Pop has four songs in the rate. We just can't stop winning girls~\n\n**Verboten\\_Prince** (8.725): Should have done this one man\u2026 Popheads makes crazy predictions but when they get a pop girl right they get it RIGHT\n\n**slimboyfriend** (8.625): damn babyqueen flopped so hard she was erased from rate history\n\n**nt96** (8.500): Remi was robbed!! Future rate winner of 202X!!\n\n**Roxieloxie** (8.200): One of the most interesting rates we've done that has such a early sub energy to it (affectionate) i love this as a snapshot of what chappell was like on the verge of her rise but not quite her peak yet, its fun little time capsule and one of the best themings i've ever seen a host do for a reveal\n\n**qazz23** (8.000): Hemlocke and Remi were the best ones here\n\n**uiscebeathaoir** (8.000): y'know once Baby Queen\u2019s out of the equation this was a pretty solid rate idea\n\n**pheromenos** (7.900): lowkey i still don't get the concept of this rate, and especially in retrospect rating midwest princess with these three khias was funny as hell\n\n**Nagisoid** (7.875): 3 pop bibles and Chappell\n\n**apatel27** (7.875): Biggest setup since tumblrcore\n\n**IIIHenryIII** (7.750): I wish I could back to fix all of my scores for Chappell\n\n**vayyiqra** (7.000): zzz\n\n**ImADudeDuh** (7.000): the best banners AND the best shitposts ever, this rate was kinda instrumental to chappell blowing up\n\n**flava** (3.875): Baby Queen you will likely never be famous\n\n---\n\nUser Averages:\n\nRandomHypnotica: 10.000\nwelcome2thejam: 10.000\ndarj: 10.000\nakanewasright: 10.000\nlexiaredery: 9.875\nWane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition: 9.650\nkrusso1105: 9.625\nGoorry121: 9.500\nCrimsonROSET: 9.500\nAmbrosia42: 9.425\nFrajer: 9.375\nWindysaStarStarStar: 9.250\ninnuendo_overdose: 9.250\nLynflower680: 9.250\npbk: 9.250\njirachi: 9.250\nbogo: 9.000\nRainbowSherbet47: 9.000\nGhost-Quartet: 9.000\nShinyTomato69: 9.000\nwathombe: 8.900\nBleepBloopMusicFan: 8.750\npijus41: 8.750\nVerboten_Prince: 8.725\nslimboyfriend: 8.625\nemayzee: 8.575\nsteelstepladder: 8.500\nPrimaryCrusaders: 8.500\njasannn: 8.500\nnt96: 8.500\nhikk: 8.500\nletsallpoo: 8.500\nNFLfreak98: 8.450\nAyzrules: 8.375\nDirtyRat583: 8.325\nskylofte2: 8.250\nContent_Love5312: 8.250\nhockeynl: 8.250\nHulnia: 8.250\nRoxieloxie: 8.200\nTragicKingdom1: 8.125\nstatic_int_husp: 8.125\nFitzMarble: 8.100\njman457: 8.075\ndiminutiveaurochs: 8.050\nbigbigbee: 8.000\nqazz23: 8.000\ntherealbayonetta: 8.000\nSFbby: 8.000\nseanderlust: 8.000\ndreamingpastel: 8.000\nuiscebeathaoir: 8.000\nTakeOnMeByA-ha: 8.000\npheromenos: 7.900\nNagisoid: 7.875\nstealthamo: 7.875\napatel27: 7.875\nIIIHenryIII: 7.750\nArcaneLabyrinth: 7.750\nAwkward_King: 7.750\nignitethephoenix: 7.650\nmoongenightmares: 7.650\nsarcasticsobs: 7.625\nundisclosedthroway: 7.625\nteam_kockroach: 7.625\nSunny_Waterloo: 7.600\nricki: 7.500\nbuildingigloos: 7.500\nTiltControls: 7.500\nbran: 7.375\nimplasdad: 7.350\nfrogaranaman: 7.250\nmustwinfullgaming: 7.250\nraggedy-princess: 7.250\ncamerinian: 7.125\nNervousLemon6670: 7.025\nvayyiqra: 7.000\ngiraffiecathie: 7.000\nImADudeDuh: 7.000\ndaftsone: 7.000\nConnerY2323: 7.000\nbabadork: 6.975\nRunaway3212: 6.875\nimpla77: 6.775\nzadooi: 6.700\nnonchalantthoughts: 6.650\nbeeozan: 6.625\nicantlikeeveryone: 6.600\nFreeCuddlesAnyone: 6.500\n1998tweety: 6.125\nmarbIeIily: 6.075\nStryxen: 6.000\nDaHumanTorch: 5.875\nPoydoo: 5.675\nkerriekipje: 5.325\nxophrys: 4.875\nfadedblue09: 4.750\nasadprofessorplum: 4.500\nflava: 3.875\nindie_fan_: 3.300",
