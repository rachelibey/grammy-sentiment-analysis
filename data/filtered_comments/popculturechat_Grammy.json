    "if anything i thought her using her DJ to fill in the lines she was out of breath for was such a smart move, it made the whole performance more cohesive and also more obvious that it was live? like, they were both on stage with mics lol",
    "Anyone who\u2019s seen her Tiny Desk concert would never think that for a second. She\u2019s talented as *hell* man. There are hoards of untalented pop stars riding mommy and daddy\u2019s money train who can barely call themselves artists, but these dorks are all WeLL aCkShuALLy LoOk aT hEr MoUtH\n\n![gif](giphy|kZD8cN1MycfKw)",
    "I love Doechii so much",
    "It\u2019s so obvious she\u2019s singling live like what \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I love her",
    "People are just making excuses to hate now because anyone with eyes could see it was live?",
    "To watch that performance and have any kind of critiques is wild \n\nIt was amazing",
    "They\u2019re just hating because the DJ, Miss Milan, is present and CLEAR in the performance for \u201cDenial\u201d on the moving floor and they\u2019re CLEARLY going back and forth. They\u2019re just mad whoever they wanted didn\u2019t win. I mean\u2026someone said Beyonc\u00e9 is lazy because they\u2019re a crazy Billie Stan, mad Billie didn\u2019t win AOTY. You can say many things about Beyonc\u00e9\u2026lazy?! That\u2019s just a lie and hater nonsense. I hate how being a psycho stan is normalized and you can just say whatever you want",
    "She is a gorgeous specimen of a human in every way.",
    "I remember watching her perform \u201cWat U Sed\u201d with Isaiah Rashad at the 2021 BET awards and being absolutely blown away by how perfect and clean her vocals were (WHILE doing choreo of course). Just incredible breath control. And she\u2019s only gotten better! People really are stupid. If you know nothing about live vocal performances you should just shut up and enjoy the artistry lol",
    "I love her she\u2019s so hot, and I mean that in personality first and foremost, just so happens she\u2019s also physically stunning",
    "I\u2019m glad she stands up for herself on this. Many times artists let these comments slide. I would be pissed too if someone said I didn\u2019t do my performance live especially if I was sick!",
    "It's so easy for people to sit on their couches and pick apart a performance! These trolls have zero understanding how much work and preparation goes into something like this. I am glad Doechii responded even though she shouldn't have to prove herself whatsoever. She is an unbelievable performer and artist.",
    "I hate that she even felt the need to respond to such obvious nonsense.",
    "it was painfully obvious to me it was live, the girl needs to breathe!!!!",
    "So stupid. The public finds someone famous and good and just says \"let's fuck with her\"",
    "I\u2019m in love with her \ud83e\udd70",
    "i love her with all my heart lol",
    "ridiculous criticism in the first place esp when a lot of SINGERS, not even rappers, use backing tracks to help with vocals. it was so clear with her breathing and placement she was rapping live.\n\nalso her skin is god damn flawless.",
    "Responding to everyone on social media is what sends these stars into an emotional tailspin. Why is it so difficult to ignore?",
    "Yeah tell them, she killed her performance",
    "I know it's not the point but she's so stunning. Like ugh imagine being that smart, funny, articulate and just beautiful",
    "Lmao I love her. It's so obvious she was singing live because you could even hear her breathing at times. She did amazing and some people really need to being overly negative about promising performers.",
    "As someone with chronic bronchitis, I struggle with even getting a sentence out while talking on the phone or in person when I\u2019m sick, let alone performing and dancing on the Grammys! My respect for her just went up 100 fold with this! WOW! (And I\u2019ve already become a fan from her performance at the Grammys and being an out queer woman).",
    "Literally HOW with bronchitis! I have it now and there\u2019s a coughing fit every ten mins. I need to know her magic! She\u2019s amazing.",
    "Seriously, do people not understand live performances? Even when it's not someone else you can't see on stage signing the live parts, you should be able to tell when they're singing and when it's just recorded audio. It's not like they're trying to fool the audience.",
    "I love her \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffd\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd23",
    "I hope she\u2019s okay, that looks like a hospital room setting",
    "It was SO obviously live!!! This isn\u2019t speaking to the use of performance tracks, this is about her, and that was SO live. Her DJ filled in a very smart way, and she\u2019s talking over her own track! She isn\u2019t trying to hide those dubs. She\u2019s performing.",
    "Seriously if you didn\u2019t notice her DJ (Milan, a talent in her own right), that was a you problem lol, she was pretty prominently featured in the performance right up in the front next to Doechii",
    "That's what I thought too. Also I don't want to hear sick voice on stage. It's enough she was even there.",
    "Good point! \u00a0That Tiny Desk concert was an amazing showcase of her artistry and how seamlessly her band and dj support each song.\u00a0",
    "So excited for someone new and so mother fucking talented",
    "People give too much credit to online comments. Like it\u2019s probably a twelve year old boy.",
    "Long days, hard work, little sleep, high stress levels and constantly going around and being in the vicinity of a lot of other people who may carry whatever kind of bugs. Not sure but a performance like that takes a ton of prep, I\u2019m sure the whole proces is exhausting and not that great for your health.",
    "Right?? I wish working while sick wasn\u2019t normal. The flu is really bad this year",
    "She's so incredible people literally can't believe it. I love her so much--she's so unique and so cool, she's resetting the bounds of what's possible. Her blackness and her intentional performance of it is so beautiful. Same goes for her femininity and her sheer brilliance.\n\nJfc what a badass. Low key crush.",
    "I was in awe when I saw it! Doechii gives me chills. I\u2019ve seen her tiny desk so many times now. So good.",
    "and she did it all with bronchitis!!!! I am all aboard the Doechii train, she\u2019s a phenomenal talent and the girls who get it, get it",
    "I\u2019m not even really a fan of Beyonc\u00e9 and I would fight someone if they said she was lazy. lol",
    "You got downvoted for this, but I totally agree.",
    "Yeah I\u2019m already well aware most people don\u2019t care. I thought we learned in 2020 but I guess not",

    "Best performance of the night! Incredible!",
    "She\u2019s so fricking awesome",
    "Amazing performance. You can tell she's a theater kid",
    "I\u2019m in love.",
    "Carrying around a giant wad of cash just for tipping must feel great.",
    "Notice she asks first - \"are you allowed to accept tips?\"\u00a0\nThat clearly shows she does this regular. Lots of places in the UK don't allow you to accept tips, when working retail/hospitality/service jobs.. she wants to show her appreciation, but ensures she doesn't get them in trouble too. Pretty classy.",
    "I know people might think this is performative, but good for her. Too many wealthy celebrities are known for not tipping or barely tipping at all (I understand they\u2019re for the event and it\u2019s not obligated but still).",
    "Guys it\u2019s not performative anymore if it\u2019s done consistently over decades. lol\n\nShe literally tipped her crew a 100k. Like come on now.",
    "Taylor has been consistently praised as always respecting and paying the people around her extremely well. Since she was a teenager she has a track record of being generous and friendly to all staff. \n\nShe knows that\u2019s not good enough for some people, as it\u2019s still perceived as performative (*covert narcissism disguised as altruism*). But she continues to do it, consistently and also privately - where it\u2019s not recorded.\n\nSo many rich or famous people are stingy little ego fucks who don\u2019t tip or respect us peasants, and they just get called iconic rockstars or divas for asshole behavior. Taylor has polite manners to service workers and people still find a way to be BEC about it \ud83d\ude44\n\nPerfection is the enemy of good enough and all that.",
    "Isn\u2019t she known for being incredibly generous with her money? And not publicising it? Like donating to go fund me\u2019s and food banks etc? I know it\u2019s becoming a trend to hate on Taylor but I say good for her!",
    "Good for her! If I were a billionaire, id be doing stuff like this too.",
    "I swear to god that Taylor could find a cure to every known cancer and people would still say it\u2019s performative and that she\u2019s only doing it because it\u2019s a disease that affects her personally.\n\nIs being gracious to workers just basic human decency? Absolutely. But I\u2019m sure the money and kindness was appreciated regardless and it\u2019s not \u201cperformative\u201d because someone who is constantly being filmed was caught being nice on camera. My lord.",
    "I am not a fan of hers for a million reasons, but I fuck with this heavily.\n\nI'm poor and I find a lot of joy in charity and I always wondered why you never saw the ultra rich doing more things like this.\n\nIf I was rich, it would make me so happy to be slipping $100s to people everywhere. I'd be like a Grandma giving you a hidden five dollar bill in front of your mom.",
    "I must say, she\u2019s good like that. Generous",
    "She does a lot and doesn\u2019t have to! She doesn\u2019t get enough credit for her kind heart. She could keep all of that money and still have all the fans!",
    "I recently worked an event at a club. Like a social club. And I cannot tell you how many people came up to me and said thank you for keeping us safe. Thank you for being on the lookout. Really appreciate you. And even that was really nice because you think you\u2019re just a fly on the wall, keeping the floors clean or keeping weirdos out of the VIP. But some degree it is  appreciated and that\u2019s kind of nice.",
    "As a long time fan what keeps her as my number one popstar is not just the great music and hard work but the fact that she has time and again proven to be a nice human. Sure, everyone in the limelight can falter on certain fronts but there are some really horrible famous people and I am glad she isn't one of them.",
    "Aww the workers sound so grateful. This made me happy",
    "I\u2019ve been a fan of her since the early days. She used to randomly give fans on Tumblr money whenever they mentioned they were struggling. She\u2019s been incredibly generous since day one, well before anyone was looking at her to call it performative.",
    "Fun fact. I\u2019ve never seen Trump tip anyone. Also one never seen him pay his bills.",
    "I honestly don\u2019t understand people who are angry about this. Even IF it is performative, she\u2019s still giving service workers hefty tips. Isn\u2019t that better than not tipping?",
    "Some billionaire artist even refuse to pay their own workers, so it's nice to see a celebrity actually do visible real good with their money that skips the middle man of \"charities\" and just give back to the people you know aren't getting paid shit.",
    "Not a fan of her music but she\u2019s a good person, very kind and generous!!",
    "Taylor\u2019s just a kind person, she really does not deserve the hate.",
    "Not to mention for the fires she posted the organizations she donated to - 11 of them I believe I counted - and did not mention how much she donated. Just that those were the ones she chose and you could donate to them too if you felt like it and could. I love that.",
    "I think this is genuine, and I adore her for it.",
    "Listen say what you will about Taylor Swift, but it says a lot of people even someone who is famous as her, if they are able to go the extra mile to tip so good for her.",
    "It would make my day to get a tip from her this is very sweet!",
    "You know what, I didn\u2019t really think anything of Taylor Swift either way a year or so back. I just had her down as this generation\u2019s answer to Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears.\n\nHaving seen/learned a bit more, I have to say that I think she is a fantastic person and an absolutely brilliant role model not just for young girls, but for people as a whole.\n\nShe seems grounded, happy, does the right thing and just seems like a really good person.",
    "I know a lot of people will say she is just doing this for the camera but she is also generous to her staff and others in private. I think taking care of the people who take care of you is about the least a billionaire can do and too few of them do it.",
    "I swear, if someone made me rich, I would do that too.",
    "I mean say what you want about her but she\u2019s always been know for being generous. Even at the start of her career. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s performative, she gave huge bonuses to the people who worked on her tour and she donates to like almost every cause. And not small donation either. \n\nIt\u2019s like the one thing about her that people should be allowed to criticize because she should be the example to follow not the exception to the rule. \n\nI had a friend work for J Lo a couple of years ago for some PR stuff and he said the vibe coming from her was that she thinks since she came from nothing and worked hard to get to this level and nobody handed her anything that people should work hard if they want something instead of asking people for help:money.",
    "Her head security guard moves with such grace. He\u2019s fascinating to watch as he shadows her.",
    "ome thing I appreciate a lot about taylor is that she really values the industry she's in, but like, collectively. it's clearly not just the artists, but stage folks, tour truck drivers, security staff at venues, record store employees ,etc.\n\n\nwe know she values her team a lot (many have been with her for years), dancers and musicians, but it's very important to value less visible parts of the entertainment industry.\n\n\nand i don't care either way if she's photographed doing it or not, but maybe this makes another rich celeb go like \"hm i guess i should tip the staff at the venue\" because it had never crossed their mind. then the staff receives more tips and that's what actually matters",
    "I don't know why people hate her so much. She seems really generous and even in this video, everyone else walked by these hardworking people like they were invisible but she stopped and talked to them and showed some appreciation for them. I'm sure Taylor has her flaws, like every other human being, but she seems pretty generous and actually cares about the world around her. She went to that children's hospital around Christmas then sent them all gifts, she donates to food banks and other great causes. As wealthy celebrities go, I think she's alright.",
    "If I had that much money I would love to do the same. It\u2019s a shame more don\u2019t do this regularly. The easiest way to make someone\u2019s day and it\u2019s nothing to them.",
    "I worked in the service industry in NYC for over 15 years. Celebrities who are generous and kind have good reputations and the ones who are assholes are widely known as such. Swift has an excellent reputation. She\u2019s the real deal",
    "I don\u2019t love her but she always seems to be tipping people, whether in front of a camera or not. Can\u2019t hate on that at all.",
    "Look, I despise her music, it\u2019s not for me whatsoever. But almost everything I\u2019ve heard about her doing, the way she carry\u2019s herself in interviews or fan interactions, she seems to be one of the extremely rare 0.0000001% of ultra wealthy human beings that corruption and greed hasn\u2019t taken ahold of yet and that\u2019s good enough for me she\u2019s one of, if not the only billionaire on the planet I\u2019d gladly shake hands with and thank them for what they do.",
    "Not a \"swiftie\" but she's earned my respect, action speaks louder than words.",
    "People are calling it performative, but money is money. It's still a generous gesture.\n\nI still prefer performative kindness over the opposite. \n\nIf I find myself in a group of people who booh her more than they booh a greedy, stingy, toxic, vicious tyrant .. then I know I am in a group with stupid priorities.\n\nYes, I know that the audience at the sportsgame booed her because they're unhappy with which sports team she supports. Like I said; stupid priorities.",
    "Money means nothing to her, but, she knows it means everything to everyone else. She is a wonderful human being",
    "She does this all the time. Usually not filmed. She is a sweetheart.",
    "Love her or hate her, she seems to be a genuinely kind person who wants to have a good time and enjoy her life.",
    "Ugh she's the worst! How dare she flaunt her money like that..... is what I would say if i was a mouth breather",
    "Shes annoying but what she did for her tour in bonuses, shes a legend.",
    "OMG I'm so glad they had a camera right there to catch all of this",
    "I love her and don\u2019t understand how anyone could dislike her. She genuinely seems like such a lovely person.",
    "I love Taylor!! She\u2019s the best!!!",
    "I'm not a fan of Taylor, but I'm a big fan of workers being paid. Good on her, I hope other artists tip at events like this!",
    "Her mama raised a very compassionate human being.",
    "Our Queen continues to Queen. Love it.",
    "It was nice of her to also say \u201cWe appreciate you so much.\u201d That goes a long way for someone to hear.",
    "I'm pretty indifferent to her, but I've consistently seen over the years that she is quite generous. So credit to her for that. She had the money in her hand too, so evidently she was always planning to hand it out.",
    "not even 1% of her wealth but my Mother is very generous and even on her own pension she tips people who help her with any chores and for good meals at restaurants... one day I asked her why she tips that much and she told me that she knows the value of hardwork, skill and hospitality. She went on assert that it is her money that she uses for tipping and it should be none of our business :)",
    "Regardless of what's said about her, or even some people booing her, she gets it done. And sets a great example. Even if it is performative, which I don't think it is, it's a nice thing. We need more of that.",
    "clearly it's better to be an asshole so that when you do something nice people aren't trying to find ways to knock you down",
    "I do not generally care for her but somewhere along the line she was taught to be kind and tip service workers, so she is aces in my book. You cannot teach this.",
    "That\u2019s so sweet of her. I\u2019ve always heard she\u2019s super generous to her staff/crew so this honestly doesn\u2019t surprise me",
    "She can be performative while still doing something good. Intention does not lessen the impact. She\u2019s always seemed to be a very generous woman",
    "Her generosity is something I've always admired and greatly appreciated about her.",
    "Does Taylor have flaws and things she sold be criticised for? Yes. \n\nWas this a nice thing of her to do? Also yes.",
    "I'd feel SO rich",
    "This is one of the primary reasons I want to be rich, to tip A LOT to people who deserve it",
    "I think that's a little unfair. Even at worst, she did a good thing here. I can't think of selfish reasons to do this. She's not responsible for the economic divide between people. And even benefitting from it, she still thinks it is important to recognize the people who do the work it takes to make her life possible. Famous and rich or not, she is still just some woman. And if I saw some woman do this, in any other scenario and if it was anyone else, I would think well of them. It must be nice having that money, but there are a lot worse ways I know she could be spending it than supporting working people. It's easy for rich people to donate large amounts to a charity and still be pieces of shit. I have yet to find someone who is a shitty person and also takes the time to thank and tip the person sweeping the floors after they leave.",
    "Some of these rich fucks don't even tip so good on her for that",
    "I don\u2019t understand how anyone can find fault in this. Taylor has many other things to bitch about, but her kindness and generosity is a constant great thing about her! \n\nETA: sorry I didn\u2019t mean to reply to you specifically",
    "There's a lot of videos of her doing this. It's super heartwarming.",
    "And their are literal hate subs for this person..lol",
    "If I was that rich, I'd have a professional bill-roller on staff. And I'd tip them too.",
    "She probably has $100s at the ready in the same way I have dollar bills at the ready in case someone needs money on the subway. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",
    "I'm a non-American & I have a question related to this. \n\nIn the UK our homeless people have complained about how difficult it is to get money from people these days. Barely anyone carries cash anymore, everything is paid via card or apps. Its that rare to need cash we get a surprise if we're told something is cash only & have to run to find a cash machine as it's not worth always having cash on us. \n\nIs it similar in the US? And have people in jobs like this clip where they rely on cash, found they are no longer receiving as much in tips due to lack of cash? \n\nI can see people in services jobs where card payments are already the norm may be doing OK as you can add a tip to your bill. And you can add a tip to an uberfood or justeat delivery. But what about people like in this clip, or the people in hotels who carry your bags, or bring your room service? \n\nOr is cash still very much a widely used thing in the US for this reason?",
    "She\u2019s a famous billionaire lol. Ain\u2019t no way she would tip that low. That would look bad. Most likely she\u2019s tipping 100.",
    "I have a pre-roll of $2 bills I get from the bank to hand out to people on the subways and streets. Started doing it at the holiday and really enjoy it. My friend once said \u201cI wonder if they think it\u2019s fake money\u201d and that gave me pause but I still love it lol",
    "One of her podcast appearances she said she requests stock of $100s to give out.\n\nI'm not even a fan of her and call her out on other hypocrises, but there's photos of her with $100s too, so I think at her level that's pretty believable, I give her that.",
    "I\u2019m gonna start keeping cash in my bag to tip people, that was a boss bitch move. Except I\u2019m poor so it\u2019ll be ones and fives instead of hundreds but still.",
    "Even if it\u2019s performative, I doubt those workers are complaining about it.",
    "Like after seeing so many billionaires giving bare minimum after the fires, i support any kind of act of giving to people",
    "She's always been known for giving tips + bonuses to everyone who works for her though. It's not hard to just accept she's a caring person. People always have to create an ulterior motive/narrative with Taylor for some reason lol, maybe she's just.... nice?",
    "I\u2019m not fan of Taylor but it\u2019s really no winning tbh.  She does it in front of cameras or announces it and it\u2019s \u201cshe\u2019s so performative, they never do it secretly\ud83d\ude12\u201d but then if she doesn\u2019t do it in front of cameras it\u2019s \u201cI\u2019d like Taylor to do some charity for once\ud83d\ude44.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s still a billionaire but idk people would complain when these workers still got paid by her.",
    "She always have been like this. She paid her band a better salary than everyone else",
    "Agreed good for the workers they deserve it",
    "I do stage rigging as a job and deconstructed the stage she performed at in Cardiff, Wales last year. I wasn\u2019t even main crew but our catering was all paid for out of her pocket, and she donated \u00a350k to charities that help fight poverty in that city, and every other city she performed at in the UK. \n\nSay what you want about the private jets she uses, legitimate criticism, but she puts her money where her mouth is at least, and looks after people. She\u2019s got the money to do so and she does.\n\nStill don\u2019t like her music, but she seems to be a better person than the internet makes her out to be",
    "People who may not necessarily get a lot of tips/earn a lot normally are getting free money. Regardless of what you think about Taylor, that\u2019s cool! Redistribute more wealth!!",
    "Taylor has always done this. It\u2019s not performative if you are always doing it and always making it a part of your brand. Like FFS someone can\u2019t be an ethical CEO? What do people want? United dude instead cheating on his wife and killing people for profit? Whatever she gave them prob covered a day of food, a bill, gas for a week, and people have the nerve to call it performative when she\u2019s been doing this for 15 years?",
    "She gave a portion of her was yours earnings to the truck drivers that drove her equipment and busses and things as a bonus. Some hit over $100k in bonuses. IDC what you think about her politics or her music. She\u2019s a fucking sweetheart.",
    "Exactly! So what if it benefits her plus them and hurts no one!",
    "It's a win-win.  Charity is a win-win.  She gets to look like the good guy, they get a little extra to do what they want.  Nobody is hurt.  Love it.",
    "It\u2019s honestly probably pretty hard for it not to be performative when literally everything you do is photographed or recorded - at that point I just start giving benefit of the doubt for all seemingly random acts of kindness.",
    "And you know what even if it's performative as long as she's doing something good and not holding it over people's heads it's all good. People are so worried about reasons not to be good instead of just doing good stuff and dealing with the consequences that don't matter at all",
    "I accept 100% of performative tips, please and thank you lol",
    "It should be encouraged. \"Oh its performative\" okay well... it's better than the performances of being a good person most celebrities do. \n\nLet's get rich people competing to be most charitable again, instead of building superyachts and destroying democracy",
    "I like the story where she gave someone her purse lmao. I forget if it was a fan or maybe a journalist but someone complimented her purse and she just emptied it and let them have it. \n\nAnd on her birthday at the children\u2019s hospital when people dragged her for wearing an expensive outfit and she sent a little girl the same outfit a few days later because the little girl complimented it. \n\nOr the 10M she donated for victims of the LA fires. \n\nI will never understand the hate for this woman. She doesn\u2019t have to do any of the things she does and is so overly criticized and ripped apart for no reason.",
    "My friend went on tour with paramore when they opened for TS recently. Not even with Taylor\u2019s team, and almost every other night she was getting goody bags and favors from Taylor, coming home (edit: to the hotel) to country-specific snacks and novelties\u2026even some commemorative jewelry too. Shes always shown gratitude",
    "Idc if it\u2019s even performative, it\u2019s nice and generous.  That extra tip makes a huge difference to someone. She feels good, they feel good.  Everyone is happy.",
    "More than 100K. She gave them 200M in bonuses all together",
    "Even if it's performative it's still real money for real people, so why should we complain about it. They're still going to be happy no matter the reasons Taylor had for doing it.\n\nI don't really like her but there's nothing to complain about with her tipping people a lot.",
    "What I struggle with is people\u2019s binary perception of celebrities as entirely good vs entirely evil. Taylor, like like the vast majority of people, does good things and bad things. She is nuanced. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to frown upon her private jet usage while simultaneously appreciating her being generous to staff.",
    "How would she go about NOT tipping performatively, though? (Not actually asking you, personally, just the world at large.) Everywhere she goes, there are cameras. Is she supposed to apply elaborate disguises and double back into buildings like a secret agent losing an enemy tail? \"Sorry guys, I see paps, so no tips today!\" SMH",
    "I love her so much \ud83e\udd79 I always remember reading some article long ago where a fan comes up to her during the interview and says it\u2019s her birthday and Taylor gives her money and says birthday dinner\u2019s on her or something lol\n\nThis has always made me feel like\u2026 damn I want to casually run into Taylor and get my palm greased",
    "I literally dont give a rats ass if its performative bc she helps people why does it even matter?",
    "She gave almost $200 million in bonuses to everyone on her Eras tour. I know for one person it was $100k.",
    "They could never make me hate Taylor. Occasionally a hateful comment makes me post a list of many of her amazing deeds she never publicized and I get downvoted into oblivion because \u201cwhat about the private jet!!!\u201d But she\u2019s a GOOD person. The world is better because she\u2019s in it.\n\nEdit: Annnnd now there\u2019s so much hatred below this comment, grasping at straws and misinformation. I\u2019ll never understand why some people don\u2019t pour their hearts and energy into the things they love instead of the things they hate. This world would be a much better place if they did.",
    "My brother in law did security for her years back on multiple occasions. He said she was always very polite and considerate towards him and the rest of his detail.",
    "Yet people all over love to lump her in with every other billionaire. It always feels like misogyny. She seems nice and is actually talented, but people will rip her (and honestly most women) apart for every action or inaction.",
    "Classy and kind.",
    "I mean there's definitely other valid reasons to criticize her but this is one of the reasons why I'll always have some respect for her. She values people's work and what they do behind the scenes and even the little things they do that people don't even realize. I'm glad her employees and the people around her are appreciated",
    "I'll support this type of narcissism any day. Lol",
    "I can't help but think it's part of why she's so successful. Being a good person to work with/for is key to success in many careers.",
    "Yeah I can\u2019t be mad at this. She wasn\u2019t filming herself, she has the ability to do so, and it made the workers happy especially when they\u2019re forgotten about. I call her capitalist Barbie every time I see her and I\u2019d still take the money and say thank you lol I\u2019m broke.",
    "She donated to the LA fires, and while she didn\u2019t publicize how much, it\u2019s rumored she gave $10 million.  During Covid she gave away smaller sums of money directly to fans (like $13,000 because she loves the number 13).  I believe she also paid for health insurance for the employees of a record store in Nashville during Covid. She gave her Eras tour truck drivers a $100,000 bonus each.  Those are just the things we know about.  She\u2019s incredibly generous and it\u2019s very heartwarming!",
    "Billboard ran a story a few weeks ago of her donation history. I think it\u2019s easy to forget how often she\u2019s donated or given away money (I forgot about her giving money to Kesha\u2019s legal defense).\u00a0https://www.billboard.com/lists/taylor-swifts-charity-donations-gifts-timeline/october-2011-she-donates-70000-in-books-to-her-hometown-library/",
    "Every city she visited on her tour she donated millions to local food banks and homeless shelters. And she gave all the truck drivers for her tour something like a $100k bonus. She\u2019s incredibly generous.",
    "People don't understand how massive this is! Truck drivers don't get bonus, like EVER. And she was handing them out 100k to EACH driver, for just 6 month touring! Several people are walking out of that Eras Tour as millionaires or half a millionaires, bet!",
    "I believe it was $100k each bonus. Life changing money.",
    "Plus this is her after party dress, so she\u2019s definitely a few drinks deep by this point and probably not focused on scheming and plotting.",
    "Exactly. I understand she does this all the time\u2026 so how \u201cperformative\u201d can it be if it\u2019s a regular thing? Let her performative her ass all day long for these hard working folks\u2026",
    "also let\u2019s say even if it was for PR, i kinda don\u2019t care if taylor swift gets good PR for doing good things",
    "True. \n\nAnd she knows this 100%.\n\nSo it\u2019s great she gives anyway, knowing she would get flack either way, at least here some deserving people get a little extra money.",
    "I like that she doesn't give a shit and does it anyway.",
    ">Doesn't give at all: cheap-ass billionaire\n\nFair lol",
    ">I swear to god that Taylor could find a cure to every known cancer and people would still say it\u2019s performative and that she\u2019s only doing it because it\u2019s a disease that affects her personally.\n\n\nHow selfish. She's leaving all those oncologists out of work.",
    "Same. Maybe I don't like certain things she does, but I've admired her charity work and heard she's a good tipper.",
    "Anytime I end up at a fancy event I always thank everyone working bc low-key I feel like I don\u2019t belong there lmao and I identify more with the staff than anyone else because I grew up super poor. So while everyone is talking about skiing and where they summered and shit I\u2019m like \u201cuhhh yeah I grew up in a trailer park and when I visited the \u201chomeland\u201d I lived in a grass hut???\u201d lol\u00a0",
    "This. She\u2019s also really generous especially with young fans. \n\nThere\u2019s a great clip of her getting papped walking into dinner or something, and this young voice says her name. She immediately stops and goes over to give the kid a hug and chat.",
    "Me too. She shows genuine respect to others, whether they are service people, other artists, her team or her fans. There are so many examples of this and just one that directly affected me and everyone that went to Eras - she started at the specified time, every night, unless there was a *force majeure* totally out of her control. This shows respect for other people\u2019s time and energy.\n\nThat along with all the charities she has supported (mostly silently), her behaviour to her team and all of these random acts of kindness, make me proud to call myself a fan.",
    "Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate",
    "I friggin loved Amandaland \ud83d\ude06.",
    "I used to work in a restaurant that would let me take leftover food after my shift to hand out to homeless people. The looks on their faces when I dropped off a bag of warm food was sometimes better than the paycheck.\n\nEdit: Not leftover like from someone\u2019s half eaten plate. Just stuff from the kitchen that would have been thrown out otherwise.",
    "My little brothers do this with their allowance. It takes them months just to save up a dollar, and the whole time they're doing chores I can hear them getting all excited and talking about what they're going to buy with all the money they've saved. But the second we leave the house and they see a homeless person at an intersection they immediately give it away.",
    "I've never understood why more rich people don't just do this. \n\nLike giving things to other people just feels so good",
    "I was a bartender and server for most of my adult life and I dream of being rich just to leave giant tips at restaurants.",
    "yeah, this is not surprising at all. She donates almost a million dollars to animal shelters in nearly EVERY city she goes to. She gave her truckers 100k, and let me tell you, there are A LOT of them. She has a huge travelling circus and they are all well cared for. She probably does more than any artist of her fame and popularity",
    "Yeah... this comment right here is where I'm at.  Personally, I do not like her music.. never have.  I really don't get the appeal.  But she's doing something very kind that MOST people at her level don't do.   I'm sure there are plenty of problems people can have with her for various reasons, but stfu about her doing acts of kindness.  Jeez.",
    "You can complain about a lot of what Taylor does and especially the use of private jets and such, but at the same time she\u2019s running a multi billion dollar business which does usually require the use of jets. \n\nShe also tipped the crew of her tour a fuck ton. She\u2019s gotten unbelievably rich(er) in the past 4 years and it seems she at the very least tries to give back.",
    "Some of the responses to your comment are absolutely wild. Some people really cannot see straight through their hatred of her yikes.",
    "She has always come across as genuinely kind, to me.",
    "She also seems to be incredibly gracious and well spoken in public.\n\nI don't see her making tweets that go viral and get mocked relentlessly, we don't see her even frown being booed at the superbowl! \n\nI've always appreciated that she's smart enough not to feed the media trolls",
    "what is ETA short for in this context lol jw",
    "> Taylor has many other things to bitch about\n\nEven most of that is weak.",
    "Uggghh feel like I've read so much bad about her, but I'm thinking it's just jealousy? I'm betting someone will spin this as calculated. Anyway, she seems kind :)",
    "I'm pretty solidly indifferent to her overall (not meant as a bad thing), but I even don't understand all the hate either. I get randomly suggested Swift hate subs sometimes and it's just bizarre how many there are!",
    "That is such a cool move. When I worked jobs that were tipped, I remember the feeling I felt when someone tipped me really generously. I can\u2019t wait to be able to afford to do that same.",
    "Just to put a point on this: If you have a billion dollars, tipping someone $100 is giving away the same percentage of your net worth as someone who has $100,000 giving away literally one penny.\n\nJust a reminder that the only reason other billionaires don't do this constantly is that they can't be bothered. Taylor Swift can be bothered, at least some of the time. Kudos to her.",
    "this picture kills me \ud83d\ude2d reminds me of grandma slipping you money when parents aren't looking",
    "What I love about this is she specifically carries money on her for this purpose. People this rich with handlers and stuff often don\u2019t pay for anything themselves, they have someone who carries their wallet for them. Hell, I\u2019m middle class and I never have cash on me unless it\u2019s for a specific purpose.",
    "I'm not a fan of her and some of the things she does, but this is a pretty classy move and I can respect that she seems to respect the people that got and keep her where she is. \n\nAlso, just insane to imagine walking around with a few grand in my pocket just for tips for the day. Like keys, wallet, phone.... hmmm im forgetting something... oh shit forgot my fat stack of hundreds for tipping.",
    "It would make me so happy. If I ever somehow become wealthy I\u2019m going to tip everyone",
    "Most billionaires become billionaires by being severely mentally ill. Their brains don\u2019t work like the rest of us.",
    "I once met a woman who had a professional joint roller on staff. Just one way she wasted daddy\u2019s money. She was, as you might imagine, not well.\u00a0",
    "I think it\u2019s partly generational and maybe cultural/regional. I never carry cash. But I dated a guy from rural Georgia who always had \u201cwalkin\u2019 around money\u201d in his wallet. My dad definitely carries cash too. \n\nIf I know I\u2019m going to have to do cash tips I\u2019ll go to an ATM or get cash back. Also sometimes when you buy something off Marketplace/craigslist the seller prefers cash.",
    "I don\u2019t know. I served David Beckham at the restaurant I worked for once, and he did tip us \u00a350, which is decent but not excessive. I never felt like he should have given more based on wealth. \n\nI appreciated even more that he was pleasant and nice to staff, which is definitely not a given for someone that famous.",
    "Because every accusation is a confession with these shitbags. They're horrible people and can't fathom somebody with good parents was raised a decent person. She's under a crazy amount of pressure, should have had some kind of heel turn by now. But no, maybe she's just fine.",
    "Right? People make her out to be diabolical but I think she\u2019s genuinely a nice and caring person. she\u2019s generous, and thoughtful of the people around her.",
    "I\u2019m not a Taylor fan either- but she does a ton of charity. She visits Children\u2019s hospitals all over the world when she tours, she fills food pantries in cities she\u2019s touring in, I\u2019ve heard of her donating to animal charities in cities she tours, etc.  \n\nPeople love to hate people, especially when they are jealous.",
    "People only want good deeds to be done secretly but to find out from others who tell everyone essentially. Someone could be the most generous and charitable person secretly (and happy for it to be kept secret) and you\u2019d never know but people will judge them because they\u2019ve not been \u201couted\u201d by anyone yet.",
    "Yeah, my cousin works for artists setting up the stages - he actually missed the opportunity to do ERAS and he was pissed because the pay was better than any of the other tours he\u2019s worked on. And we\u2019re talking very big names. She also gives good bonuses.\u00a0",
    "Yeah I don't like her music either but everything I've seen about her leads me to believe she seems to be a decent human.\n\nHowever I don't think billionaires exist but I don't think she is evil for her wealth considering who you can compare her too.\n\nI also don't understand much of the hate she gets either.",
    "I don\u2019t personally care too much about whether or not it\u2019s performative because we have actual billionaires buying the White House so like at least it\u2019s a net positive for the people she\u2019s \u201cperformatively\u201d giving money to",
    "Rich people used to build parks and schools and libraries for the public, it would be amazing to go back to that kind of rich people behavior!",
    "I started to listen to Taylor\u2019s music last year after not really being a fan for like 15 years. And the hate she gets has made me understand the song Shake It Off. Yes, I know the song is repetitive and the lyrics are simple. But I can\u2019t help but sing it in my head every time a thread like this one comes up. People who are determined to hate her will find a reason to complain about her no matter what she does. It must be so exhausting to have people pick apart every single thing you do. She has no choice to but to shake it off, because internalizing that constant, undeserved hatred would destroy a person.",
    "I think she gave her all the cash she had and told her not to go to chipotle and go somewhere a little nicer for her bday lol",
    "Yeah her security guy who stops with her is like \u201cFFS this again, we gotta go\u201d",
    "She did another set of bonuses at the end of the tour in 2024, bringing the total to $200 million",
    "Sure and I agree with that sentiment. But I still stand by saying it\u2019s not performative. I think generally in American culture it\u2019s a crutch and defensive reaction to call out charity as performative but even beyond that deeper cultural issue - if something is a habit done consistently over time it ceases to be performative.",
    "Yeah I meant 100k each, thanks for clarifying though.",
    "I remember an old interview she did with Letterman, she was pretty young, and mentioned health insurance/benefits for her tour staff, and he was surprised that she offered that, and she was surprised that he was surprised.\n\nI know, billionaires bad and all, but I think she takes care of her people and seems to be courteous to event staff too. And I know the Eras tour was making large food pantry donations in each city. It's not nothing. We can argue the ethics of being a billionaire or her carbon footprint or whatever, but those things are a net good.",
    "And it also should be noted her private jet usage does not even register in the charts of top private jet celeb flights. Even during her tour. \n\nShe was a scapegoat for that, because her name gets more engagement than for example Celine Dion or Beyonc\u00e9, who were actually in the top 10. The actual top guy? Can\u2019t remember his name. Cause no one brings it up, cause no one knows - cause it wasn\u2019t a headline to use his name. \n\nIt made better headlines to go after her, more clicks, more traffic, more ad views, better memes. Some people are salivating for any reason to jump on the hate train and the media fed them (the hate subs are extreme evidence of how desperate these folk are for a crumb of those crackers). \n\nBut yet no one ever brings up that those other celebs must also be criticized for their jets or whatever other potential wrong they\u2019ve done in every post praising them. It may happen to an extent - after some news hits or something - but it\u2019s not as pervasive. \n\nIt is a curiously Taylor thing, that people have to say \u201cI\u2019m not a fan but\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like her but\u201d \u201cthis was good but\u201d. \n\nOf course she\u2019s not a saint. Everyone is nuanced. But it\u2019s the way people have selective standards that\u2019s funny. Adding a moral and carbon footprint check to the end of every compliment. \n\n\nLike have at it, but give that energy for everyone. Hold every celeb to these standards. Direct the accusations to the right people. \n\nAnyway, I\u2019m just giving thumbs up to anyone being polite to service staff \ud83d\udc4d god knows normal people can\u2019t even manage a thank you half the time",
    "I think this is true. She got stuck in Florida during a hurricane once and instead of hunkering down with the other rich people she went to a nursing home and volunteered, keeping them entertained by singing, helping to serve food, etc etc",
    "I don\u2019t care about her music, but she\u2019s a great role model for any young woman.",
    "And while I hate to defend the 1% needlessly, a lot of her net worth is tied up in the value of her masters; that she\u2019s never going to want to sell. She probably doesn\u2019t have a billion dollars in liquid cash which some people seem to wilfully ignore. I\u2019m sure she has more money in her checking account than most of us could earn in 10 lifetimes, but people also need to conceptualise how many people the Taylor Swift\u2122 brand employs and supports too. Hundreds? Thousands? Security, assistants, house staff, managers, her family, drivers, band members, etc, and we\u2019ve heard from her staff that she pays well and has better benefits. \n\nYou have to be greedy to get the amount she has, and I\u2019m always for adequate taxation of the insanely rich, but people thinking celebs have millions and billions in liquid cash always irks me.",
    "Not just the truck drivers, right? Didn\u2019t she end up giving several million in total because she gave everyone from the tour a massive bonus?",
    "she also donated to hurricane helene, which is a lot more than a lot of celebs and rich people can say. appalachia pretty much got ignored",
    "She gave out a total of \\~$197,000,000 in bonuses for people who worked on the Eras tour.  Bonuses, to be clear, not contractual pay.",
    "Why not both? After my dad died, I stayed in a hotel for two weeks while I got things sorted out. He had left wads of money around the house and instead of taking it to the bank, I just tipped every hotel employee I saw, every day. It just felt so nice to be able to say thank you to the people who were helping me out during such a rough time. I am Italian and I watched my dad hand out wads of cash my whole life and it felt good to do it myself. Maintain my opinion that people who don\u2019t tip do not know what real joy feels like.",
    "I was a dishwasher in high school. I would eat off of people's plates. Almost 40 now and still healthy. Well, I think so anyway, I don't go to the doctor",
    "I usually don\u2019t carry cash, but when I do and someone else is in need, I give it all to them. My philosophy is that they obviously need it more than I do at the moment, and I rarely have more than $30 anyway, so I\u2019d rather give it to them vs. separating or saying something callous about getting change for them. At least I can help them now, because I may not be able to in the future.",
    "Exactly.  I remember when she donated 100,000 to the Djs family who got shot at the chiefs parade after their Super Bowl win last year and people were so nasty saying she should\u2019ve donated more and I also read she donated 10 million to the people in LA for the wildfires.  She is a very kind and giving person apparently because she could\u2019ve done nothing.",
    "Yeah she was in town a few months ago and the hype was insane. Like, government getting involved and tons of news coverage and fans lined up before the sun came out to get merch.\n\nNow I'm a 37 year old dude, I have virtually no interest in Taylor Swift, but I couldn't believe the amount of people my age that were bothered by it.\n\nLike, even if you're not a fan, it's undeniable how much business she was bringing into town. And the stuff she's promoting are values like be nice to each other and loyal to good friends.\n\nWhy anybody is bothered by it, I just don't know.",
    "My buddy Is a stage hand for some huge venues in Denver. He has worked shows that were headlined by Taylor Swift, pink, and other big name artist. Pink didn\u2019t allow the stagehands and other workers too even look her away. She even requested at times for no one else be in the room with her.",
    "And she\u2026 buys the carbon credits for it. She obviously isn\u2019t in a position to feasibly NOT fly private but she offsets it. At the same time what\u2019s the other option? She just NOT support climate change and stuff? It\u2019s like telling someone who supports climate change and advocated for legislative changes and tries to do what they feasibly can to help to stop driving to work.\n\nAwareness and acceptance are important and that\u2019s how she can best help.",
    "lol I had to unfollow the thread \ud83d\ude02 wild bc I thought I was a Taylor hater but ig not lol",
    "I don't understand how people hate her.\n\nI've heard some of her songs and like a few of them, not a fan by any means.\n\nBut hate her?  Has she done something controversial that I missed?",
    "I've seen people go, \"yeah, but that's nothing to her\" because she's so rich. And I think, plenty of rich people are stingy af, so if she was, it'd be nothing to her to NOT tip. She's well known to be generous. I'm not a Swiftie, but I think it's cool that she takes care of her own staff and staff at these venues. Plus I read that her tour made huge food pantry donations at each stop for Eras, which I think is great. I would love to be able to afford to be really generous.\n\nI put myself through college with tips from a restaurant job. I've never been rich, but I always try to tip as generously as I can because I know what it's like to depend on that income.",
    "Exactly. I worked restaurants for a long time and I remember what a difference even just 2 to 5 dollars over 25% would make for my day and so when I\u2019m tipping I remember that those couple extra bucks probably aren\u2019t going to break my bank but they\u2019re gonna make my server\u2019s day better.",
    "When I made more money I used to overtip all the time even tho I could have used that money to pay down student loans. I just felt so guilty for making six figures after working a lot of low paying retail jobs for a lot of my early 20s \ud83d\ude2d.\u00a0",
    "Yeah my dad (who I don\u2019t talk to) is super rich and always told us \u201cYou don\u2019t stay rich by sharing.\u201d Always bugged me as a kid. He\u2019d lecture us over breakfast about how he wasn\u2019t going to leave us anything when he died, so we\u2019d better not expect it. It wasn\u2019t until I was older that I realized the irony; he inherited most of his fortune.",
    "I spent 6 months living in Philadelphia a decade ago and couldn\u2019t believe how behind the times with financial technology they were! We were long into having chip cards and even tap by then and I was shocked at first having to hand someone my credit card and never have a chip",

    "Here\u2019s the thing about performative money: \n\nIn capitalism, the only form of power is money. Giving people money is literally empowering them. The reason is unimportant. \n\nIn capitalism, the absence of power (money)? Eventually, that is violence.",
    "I\u2019m pretty sure it was everyone in her tour (that travels to every venue) got 6 figure bonuses",
    "She's so fast and slick with it, she's clearly done it a long time.\n\nTipping is FUN. Every year at the holidays,  my kid and I order some cheap food delivery and tip $100. It's fun for US to do that.",
    "People also confuse net worth with cash in the bank. Obviously many billionaires abuse the system by leveraging their debt to pull shit like avoiding taxes BUT it doesn't change my point that a large amount of people think Taylor has a billion sitting in her chequing account.",
    "And people only knew because some of the food banks publicly thanked her. She also donated what\u2019s most likely 10 million dollars to organizations helping with the LA fires recently.",
    "She quietly donated 25k to a cat rescue I work with.",
    "Yeah, about the only valid criticisms one can have for her are that she exploits her fans by releasing 1000 variants of her albums and that she flies private. The former is a standard industry practice at this point. As for the latter... sure, she travels too much. But I don't think people realize that if she wants to travel, she almost HAS to fly private. A car isn't always fast enough and wouldn't get her to Europe or Asia. Plus, someone of her fame level would shut down an airport if she flew commercial. There's ways of mitigating this but I think she's just too famous.",
    "YES \ud83d\udc80 I\u2019ll take one too. I always see these online activists say things like \u201cwell she only donated .01% of her wealth, that\u2019s nothing for a billionaire.\u201d Ok sis, are you donating .01% of your wealth anytime soon?",
    "Exactly! Everything is kind of performative except for charity given in secret. Taylor is awesome for this",

    "Agreed. I'm a fan of Harry Styles and he's had the exact same line up since he went solo. He even set up his drummer and guitarist who are now married and Harry is godfather to their child. He says that he's just the front man for the best band.",

    "Yeah, not a knock at TS but there are plenty of celebs with very longstanding, steady careers that are horrible people.",
    "She could literally have someone on her payroll whose sole job was to handle tipping and folks would be like \u201cwhat she can\u2019t do it herself? She needs someone else to tip the peasants? She could tip more if she wasn\u2019t paying that person\u201d like omg give it a rest.",
    "Yeah, I'm studying environmental related stuff in my masters and my friends legit prefer taking buses and trains over flights and eat vegan or vegetarian (including me). And I'm pretty much a swiftie and my environmentalist friends barely go into hate rants about her private jets when I say anything about her.\n\nIf you ask them they'd obviously say taking a private jet like that is selfish (so do I) but yeah they seem to enjoy her music (and humor me at karaoke) and her haters online seem a bit unhinged to me...",
    "God I HATE the private jet discourse so much because even if someone flies a jet all the time, THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN FUCKING UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR LITERALLY 100 YEARS. And that doesn\u2019t even include coal mining or coal burning plants.\u00a0\n\nYes they could stand to use their jets less but the amount of people using private jets like that is barely a drop in the bucket of how much climate damage big corporations have done over the past few hundred years.\u00a0",

My point is, even *normal* people wouldn't do something like that! It goes to show how big her heart is and what a generous spirit she has. Wow, this story just totally made my day. I've always liked Kristin Bell but this just confirms for me why I felt drawn to her. What a human.",
    "wow this is great.",
    "This drives me nuts too. I think last time the music she owns was valued around $500 million. She gives a lot of money away and she has been paying her crew generously for years. She gives them full benefits and healthcare and has since she was a teenager. I know there\u2019s to snark on her about, but her generosity is not one.",
    "\\*whispers\\* I think it is smart that she employs her family instead of just handing them money. They work for her and do important stuff at that like her brother managers her catalogue, but they also get a nicer life than anyone can imagine.",
    "Yeah, close to $200 million in bonuses went to her team",
    "I think so. I remember hearing about her dancers getting a big bonus",
    "Yeah, it was around $50k for each person on the crew, from techs, roadies, stylist, etc. My brother is a professional tour tech for a band and knows a couple of people who were on the Eras crew. What a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that the people who work behind the scenes for touring bands/musicians are essentially independent contractors, so they only get paid when they\u2019re on the road and have to find other gigs to fill the gaps if the band they usually work for is not currently touring. Some bands keep some of their crew on retainer and pay them an annual salary so they\u2019re available when needed for touring, but that\u2019s not the norm for the workers outside of the specialized tech roles. I\u2019m sure those bonuses were a huge deal for that crew.",

    "Based on her comments in the Time Person of the Year interview and her openness in TTPD lyrics, I genuinely think she really doesn\u2019t care about public opinion anymore. She realised long ago (snake gate mainly but from many incidents), that you can\u2019t control if people will gossip, talk shit and like you or hate you, so you might as well do what you want. \n\nThe only thing that will last is the music she makes. In ten or twenty years no one will give a shit what people were saying on Reddit or Instagram.",
    "that's nice but I'm sure people who live paycheck to paycheck would also love to tip so they can feel \"what real joy feels like\". \n\nhanding out wads of cash requires the privilege of having wads of cash to give.",
    "I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re struggling. I\u2019ve been there when I was badly in debt, it\u2019s so tough. Hope you\u2019re able to get financial stability soon. \u2764\ufe0f",

    "that's not really how tax write-offs work.  What happens is that they don't pay taxes on the money they donate (up to 50% of their income).  Because Taylor has had so much income this year, she actually needs to make huge donations (if she wants the tax credit on it).  \n\nAlso, tipping workers is not a donation, and she can't deduct it.  In fact, she likely has to pay the gift tax on it in addition to normal income taxes. (in the US, the giver of a gift has to pay taxes instead of the reciever. A tip can be payment for services, but if you're giving $100 tips.. the IRS is not going to be happy with you).",

    "Oh my goodness, Harry Styles is honestly great. I didn\u2019t get into One Direction, only really heard their music if I was with friends who liked them. I didn\u2019t dislike them, I just didn\u2019t get into their music. Once Harry Styles went solo though I realized he is a damn lyricist! Like he\u2019s really good, I like his music a lot. \n\nThere was one time a friend told me to look up a song of his when I mentioned liking his music a lot now. She told me not to watch the music video though, told me it would probably make me cry cause a fish is in emotional distress. I\u2019m a sensitive one and if I see another being in emotional pain it will make me cry. I made the mistake of watching the music video and cried over a CGI fish being upset. She was definitely right to tell me to avoid the music video lol.",

People reported just shy of 200 million ([link](https://people.com/taylor-swift-gave-eras-tour-crew-usd197-million-in-bonuses-exclusive-8758216)). There's also a CNN article saying that truck drivers got a bonus of $100k, so that gives us an idea of what those bonuses looked like for everyone ([link](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/business/taylor-swift-100000-life-changing-bonus-truck-crew/index.html)).\n\nI will always agree that there is no ethical billionaire, but the way she gives out money like this makes me think she really understands that her wealth is built in the backs of average people.",

There\u2019s a lot of YouTube clips of her singing with residents and kids \u2764\ufe0f",
    "It wasn\u2019t a slight at all! It\u2019s so nice they work and spend so much time together, especially with both her parents having high flying careers, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re not well equipped in a business sense. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s easy to forget that all the money she earns doesn\u2019t go in to her pocket, it goes in to the pockets of *everyone* that depends on her for their salary!

I am working in this way too by the way, like many many many people who are not artists.\n\nIf she wanted to be radical, she could go up there advocating for universal health care.

The myth/allure of the \"struggling artist\" exists for a reason. They were living out of their vans, working at bars, writing books/music on the side waiting to make it big. (Before that, they were sponsored by rich people.)\n\nBut it's so much harder to be that kind of artist today. Nobody can afford to go live alone in a cabin for a year to write the next great american novel or self fund their own tour. That's the real issue and it's not an industry problem, that's an overall cost of living problem. \n\nIt's good that young people today are more political and care more about things like universal healthcare and speak up about these things. But there's also a disconnect because with social media today anyone can be famous, and they all expect to be able to make money off their side hustle/ tik toks/ self published book/ garage band. It never worked like that, and it actually can't work like that. Not everyone can be a full-time artist.

I wonder if the reason she's doing background vocals on Sour was because Dan Nigro was trying to get her covered employment so she could qualify for insurance.\n\nThe real issue is that she got dropped in 2020.  This both was horrible for her... it was also a really really stupid decision!  Atlantic lost a ton of money on her.  Island has made a fortune!  This is the year of breakout artists.  And yet... all these artists were \"in development' for a really long time.  Charli XCX was signed (to asylum) in 2010... she had it the easiest because she has written over the years a number of unbelievably big hits for other artists (I love it, and Senorita).  Sabrina Carpenter was first signed (to Hollywood Records) in 2015. Chappelle was signed to atlantic in 2015.  Gracie Abrams was signed in either late 2018 or early 2019.  So all of these artists have been working for years for record labels, making very little money (Charli did the best), and suddenly 10 years later they break out.  Both Sabrina and Chappelle have been on two different labels!  If this is how long it takes to break out, this isn't sustainable.",
    "i'm not sure that's true.  Just looking at the SAG-AFTRA benefits page, it seems that artists on label rosters automatically qualify.  I do know that labels pay a ton of money to the musicians unions in Union Exploitation Charges (several points on every record), plus a fee for every new artist on their roster.  These charges sometimes come up in record deals (artists on distro deals are often required to pay them instead of the labels)\n\nThe deal the labels have with the unions is quite different than the deal for motion pictures...",

You get signed as a contractor, which gives you the ability to maintain some ownership over your music, and benefit more significantly if you succeed. \n\nIf musicians become employees, they will then have the same rights to their IP as an Apple engineer would have over the apps they built while they were working at Apple (none). \n\nAdditionally, the vast majority of musicians who sign record contracts are not going to be profitable investments. It\u2019s very much a shotgun game where you go broad and hope to hit with one or two. So if labels had to start paying all of their artists $40k/ year or whatever, they would basically have to stop signing people (my first advance was something like 1000\u00a3).\n\nIf you got dropped from a contract where you were paid a small advance, you\u2019re not going to get signed to one where you have to be paid many times more for a longer period of time, with the funds not being tied to any performance metrics. \n\nBasically, a pretty huge amount of want-to-be entertainers don\u2019t really provide any real value to society, so treating them like factory workers, whose wage is tied to their real output doesn\u2019t really make sense.",

She should have said that lol\u00a0\n\n\nAnd I really wouldn't care that much if she wasn't continually propped up as having better more concise speech than she does.

They say she's a socialist queen.....this is literally the exact opposite of socialism, this is actually a distinctly private market capitalist solution.\u00a0\n\n\nI just need people to stop getting so much of their policy rhetoric from a pop star. If this is meaningfully shaping the conversation, then we're fucked. I don't need musicians to be super into the details.

Ife gotten emotional at it before....but the way she's politicizing it feels out of touch and sour.

Just say \"healthcare is a human right\" or something vague about how keeping people locked out of healthcare is unacceptable.\u00a0\n\n\nESC works for middle to high earners really well. The higher up the income ladder you go, the better deal it becomes. The power you go, the shittier it gets. Right now theres this huge Medicaid gap where a lot of people are not able to get Medicaid, but cannot get an actual real fucking plan they can use, because the costs are astronomical.\u00a0\n\n\nTHAT is the core problem. Insurance works really good for rich people, we have a safety net for absolutely poverty, and we are fucking over the lower class workers. That precise segment is who the ESC primarily fails.\u00a0\n\n\nESC isnt the solutions. It's literally like 2/3 of the problem.\n\n\nAnd it espeically showed what a bad system is during the pandemic when we saw people getting laid off en masse and realized \"oh wow it's also just really stupid to tie these things together for other reasons as well\".\u00a0\n\n\nIt wouldn't help artist like Chappell. They are getting fucked over. They do lack basic security. But ESC is ...it's nothing in practice. It's cost inaccessible, it would increase the rate at which they get dropped, and they all still would have found themselves with no money and no prospects and no insurance in 2020. That's the problem. Is we keep doubling down on ESC like you can bootstrap your way out of insurability and it's just not true. Employers will never do it willingly. It makes the employees too expensive to offer good insurance, cause they're also getting shafted by insurance.\u00a0\n\n\nIt's a really complex tangled web of fucked upness and it's really important to emphasize over and over and over that ESC does not actually meaningfully help poor people. Most cannot actually see their doctor if they're insured at all. A huge chunk who are technically offered go without so they can buy luxuries like food and a car which gets them to their shitty job\u00a0",

How can you support trans and gay rights while also demonizing those that want to protect you??\n\nJust shows you birds of a feather flock together. She\u2019s a hypocrite and you are too LOL",

    "Okay, did you miss the part how that's not exactly proof? The girl posted the screen-recording of Taylor Swift liking the Joe Alwyn post\u2014 it was proven to be faked.\n\nI don't doubt she got the email. My hesitation is that it was actually from the assistant and not someone pretending to be her to scam free stuff. Phishing scams are the most common scam. God forbid I withhold judgement until there's something that's actually definitive.",

    "I'm just wondering, how do you know that person is still on her team?  Because that email is from last years grammys and that management team was completely fired.",
    "She should have used the $3000 to join the union is my point. That should literally be the first thing you do. Unsigned artists hustle for studio time. I known this for a fact. And they'd jump for the chance to join a professional union.\u00a0\n\n\nIt just really seems like we keep circling around the same \"universal healthcare because ESC is stupid\". Where if you insist on an industry specific talking point, it's higher pay and the union. Not ESC.\u00a0\n\n\nShe wouldn't have been able to afford ESC if she can't afford union dues. Again, the union insurance is a lot better than a lot of ESC plans.\u00a0\n\n\nIf she's gonna keep delving into nuanced political issues, she should be ready for nuanced political pushback analysis. Otherwise just say \"fuck the industry, healthcare is a human right\". I am entirely fine with artists keeping it vague.\u00a0",
    "Email looked very real. Not sure if someone with that much to lose (her business) would lie about a celebrity like Chappell with fans who would ignore any faults to attack someone calling out their favorite artist.",
    "You don't get those benefits unless you're working though, and by \"working\" they mean making money.   Someone further upthread said you had to make 27k yearly income as a recording artist to qualify for union insurance.\n\nI have a friend working in film, not quite the same, but similar.  You don't just \"get\" benefits - you have to work your ass off to make hours to qualify for the union, and if something happens to interrupt those hours/earnings qualifying you.... you get dropped.  So the union support is still mostly predicated on the stability of your career, it's not a safety net in the way you're thinking for many smaller artists.\n\nYou don't know if she paid into the union or not either, I'm guessing.\n\nIt's just frustrating when artists talk about problems in the art industry everyone is ready to come out and share that things are harder outside of the art world without acknowledging that all of this works in a very different way.  And tbh it ends up sounding like \"artists should just get real jobs\" a lot of the time.\n\nThere are ways to improve this - older seasoned artists with high income could pay more in dues, record labels could be required to pay into unions so artists could have more stable coverage, and in that way once you qualify you wouldn't be dropped as a newer or lower income artist when tines get rough.",
    "Dems aren\u2019t perfect and yes they are in bed with corporate interests just like the republicans. But there is a time and place to have that discussion. Not 1 month before a major presidential election. \n\nIt comes off as HYPOCRITICAL when you demonize one party for not doing something 100% the way you want when overall they support you, when the other party is literally openly saying they are going to remove your rights.",
    "I didn't say that. I said if she's gonna make a VERY specific demand which doubles down on the way healthcare is broke while public policy advocates are pushing in the exact opposite direction, then kind of need a coherent explanation\n\n\nDoes she think if she's bringing in no money they're gonna pay $500/month in her behalf? If she wants to be an employee, they're gonna fire her even sooner. That's just the reality of labor..if you're not bringing in money, if you're red in the books, they cut you. That IS every industry including the \"real\" jobs. I'm not putting art as lesser than real jobs. I'm questioning if Chappell has actually meaningfully thought about what she just asked for. Because it doesn't make sense to me\n\n\n\n\nIt seems like they just need higher pay. Probably like a union version of COBRA. I don't understand the thought process of ESC would have helped her\u00a0\n\n\nIf you can't afford the union dues, you can't afford ESC deductibles. If you arent bringing in enough to qualify for the union .....you're not making enough to qualify for your label paying your insurance premiums. It just seems like *at best* a lateral move, probably a net negative. And wasn't what she should have asked for.\u00a0\n\n\n(Which was more money and universal healthcare or like expanded Medicaid, getting the union to lower the threshold so there isn't a gap between Medicaid and insurance, etc)\n\n\n\n\nI just don't think artists should ask for very specific things unless they actually have thought through that specific thing. And considering how left she is and how exploitative she understands the industry is and the fact she was presumably in poverty ....I'm not understanding how she arrived as ESC\n\n\nThe entire problem is that healthcare tired to labor doesn't make sense, and Medicaid limits are way too fucking low so people cannot reasonably buy in. So there's a huge gap. It's *not* unique to her industry, and I think ESC seems really poor suited to the industry *because* they're not typical employees\u00a0",
    "Well, she simply shouldn\u2019t have had to ask to be paid for her work. It\u2019s a given. And no, it doesn\u2019t surprise me. Again, Chappell\u2019s fans can be ravenous. So I can understand attempting to move on and then seeing the person who essentially tried to obtain stuff from you for free, during the rise of her career, speaking up about paying artists would be triggering enough to make them come forward. Cause and effect.",
    "it was proven via screen recording the email was real. ppl saying it was only brought up after the grammys for clout are deliberately ignoring the context. the nail tech only came forward after chappell went on stage and whined about how her label wasn\u2019t compensating her and other artists fairly. its extremely hypocritical for her and her fans to rally behind compensation for artists but then ignore and put down smaller artists when they ask for compensation from her.",
    "lol what!? Okay lol. There\u2019s actual video proof of it. Y\u2019all are just weird stans",
    "She's addressing a completely different kind of work than employment where you work for someone and are their outright employee.\n\nThe arts and artists really function on very different forms of employment and reimbursement and it's very difficult to compare if you haven't worked in that area, and that's why \"just get real employment\" = ends up sounding like just saying artists should just, like, not work in arts if they want better conditions.\n\nI don't just mean music, like theatre, fine arts, etc, all use employment and funding models that tend to stray from the \"x company employs me and I do what they say in exchange for y\", which makes complete sense if you think about the type of work done.  \n\nSaying just get a job that's a \"normal\" job - okay, but artists deserve to be able to ask for better working conditions as well, even if you don't understand how how that kind of work is often done or don't value it.  I've been an independent artist and I've been in STEM and it's foolish to think that arts don't matter and artists should just get \"real\" jobs if they want stability, art is essential to a healthy society.  And no, the US is not healthy right now, and I will always disagree with people who think asking for more and better is the problem.",

If she was afraid of backlash it wouldnt make sense to wait until the celebrity won a grammy. Maybe she is telling the truth, but its just strange.

Her speech may not change things, but it addresses the correct people and identifies a specific issue they are in fact responsible for and can change. They absolutely can offer healthcare when they sign an artist and choose not to.",
    "I hear you and agree. Powerful companies could lobby for a national healthcare system and I think that would actually help us get one.

I don\u2019t care what someone\u2019s motives are as much as what they\u2019re able to accomplish.\n\nAnd in this case, I\u2019m just happy she didn\u2019t go up there and make some general speech about a national or global issue. She identified an issue within that community specifically. Whether or not she\u2019s a hypocrite in that moment doesn\u2019t matter to me as much as there\u2019s now a public record of an artist addressing the need for healthcare in the industry. \n\nAnd honestly, if people want to use her words against her going forward to hold her accountable, I\u2019m all for that.

I disagree that chappel is this (right now), and I do think it\u2019s unfair to label her as this just because some other pop stars use relatability as a parasocial marketing strategy.\u00a0\n\nBut getting up at a podium and standing up for human decency during a time when people are recognizing your work with an award is nothing to scoff at. Wish more people would do it instead of plugging their next album or even thanking god. It gets people talking at minimum. Hopefully it gets people thinking. And possibly, enacting change.

    "most countries have universal healthcare. those places have musicians, toilet-scrubbers and all types of workers. there\u2019s nothing wrong with chappell roan, a big artist, raising concerns about smaller artists not being able to afford healthcare. if you don\u2019t value art or think we can strive for a higher standard of living across the board, then i can\u2019t help you.",
    "Then you engage the system to actually do you good. Asking label leadership on an stage isn't gonna do shit. They know what they're doing. They do not care. Rally your fellow artists to push for labor reform through collective bargaining. Everything else is theater.\n\n\n\n\nThere's unions that don't earn their keep. UFCW is pretty infamous for this.\u00a0 Usually through disengagement of membership -- either through high turnovers or encouraging a \"fuck you, got mine\" culture.\u00a0\n\n\nIt still becomes a question of artist led collective bargaining. The execs are comfortable being the bad guys and the fellow big name artist are let off the hook because it's not their fault, they're not the bad guys. The system festers like it has for decades.\u00a0\n\n\nWhat specifically does she even want? Label provided coverage wouldn't have addressed the gap she and many other artists faced. Does she want severance built into contracts? It harder to drop artists? Catastrophe insurance? Longer windows of non productivity if they get insurance through SAG? A union that actually meaningfully represents the fairly unique needs and aspects of the music industry (which are not reflective of the radio ecosystem from 80 years ago)?",
    "It\u2019s going to take port strikes level of protest to get any of this moving. Like to where the artists and I mean big names and people in droves to protest the labels for them to consider it.\n\nThe port strikes struck fear that if they didn\u2019t get paid, ain\u2019t nobody getting goods or money.\n\nThe reason I say this is that if the Luigi mangione situation jump started the conversation\u2026.it fizzled out quickly despite sending the message.",
    "It's gotta be metal though right? The guttural sounds of gargling on a dick.",
    "She just watched an artist she dropped win bna. \u00a0And A&Rs get points on records(usually 1%). Chapelle has done already sonething like 12 million in revenue, so\u2026 yeah that\u2019s 100k down the drain. \u00a0More. \u00a0I\u2019m sure she\u2019s very salty\u00a0(though if her first name is emily, she's probably not that salty)",
    "Didn\u2019t she say \u201c*I* felt used?\u201d It felt more like whining about how hard she had it becoming a world famous, pop star not about blue collar workers paying for treatment. And, once again, I\u2019ve been in the same boat as her. \n\nI\u2019ve paid for my health insurance because the pay I was getting made being an independent contractor more lucrative. I also had medications to take that cost an arm and leg out of pocket. \n\nBut I knew I\u2019d made my choice so I wasn\u2019t whining on social media about how I felt used by the construction company I worked for didn\u2019t pay me super high wages **and** free insurance. \n\nWhy is she held to different standard?",
    "fun fact: in brazil it's free for foreigners too, which is very useful, especially around the holiday season, due to the heat/potential food related issues",
    "Because the world isn\u2019t your piggy bank. The majority of Americans who make the hard but necessary choice to join the workforce and pay their taxes shouldn\u2019t have to subsidize free insurance for the people that just want to work in low paying, low benefit jobs like the arts. \n\nIt\u2019s the people who *choose* to work in that industry who bear the cost and responsibility for handling their healthcare. Same as the blue collar workers or low wage workers.",
    "Yes she would lol\n\nAnd she\u2019d have wait lists. Oh actually no she wouldn\u2019t cause she\u2019s a rich celebrity so they\u2019d probably skip her to the front of the line. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019d say that was fair too right?",
    "\"I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage, and healthcare especially, to developing artists\"\n\n\"It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanized to not have help.\"\n\n\"Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\"\n\n\nMaybe you should be whinging about it on social media? That's how change happens? By having these conversations and saying actually no this isn't fair.",
    "No actually we are there to subsizide fucking art majors.\n\nGuess what we listen to on the way to our jobs: fucking art majors, guess what's on the radio playing over the supermarket speakers for those shopping or working? ... fucking art majors.\n\nCreative people pursuing their dreams and making music, movies, tv shows, books etc! They are making things that entertain us and they deserve to have healthcare and feel safe and supported to express themselves into their art so we can enjoy it? \n\nHelping people pay for a blood test or medication is not \"helping people make it big in the industry\", it's being a decent human being.",
    "I'm on paid annual leave from my job in a country that gives me 4 weeks paid annual leave and 10 days paid sick leave by law per year... so I've got all day to reply to your comments, but you aren't replying to me...  did i say something to upset your fractured idea of the american dream? \ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\n\nEdit just to rub it in: I've got a four day weekend cos we had a public holiday yesterday, which is a paid day off for everyone scenario. If you happen to work on a public holiday here, you get time and a half and a day in lieu (day off to take at a later day).",
    "wow you\u2019re far gone huh?",
    "Well they\u2019re currently subsidizing bombs so, yeah they should.",
    "Oh you\u2019re just a straight evil person too I get it now.",
    "the person I'm thinking about signed Charli, so she's probably fine.  Best not to name names.",
    "You\u2019re saying an entertainer like Halsey contributes more to society so she deserves more in terms of pay then, say, a nurse?",
    "The truth is, your amount of paid leave is also common in the US, but it's tied to your job and not the government. You can have a great job with great benefits, even unlimited paid/sick leave (Not that it works out to be a real benefit. Many people end up taking less time off if it's \"unlimited\"). \n\nBut there are also people who work just as hard in jobs that don't provide any benefits because they're contractors or have multiple part-time jobs. This inequality is built into the system when you make benefits contingent on employment.\n\n It also makes it harder to leave your job or even attempt to be an entrepreneur or artist. It's built to keep you in the rat race and fighting for scraps like the comment you're replying to.",
    "I\u2019m a nurse in Canada where my tax dollars subsidize everyone\u2019s healthcare. Artists, college kids, stay at home parents, homeless people on the streets. I will gladly pay that every time because all humans deserve healthcare. \n\nThe amount I pay into taxes for free healthcare is not the main thing keeping me from achieving Halsey\u2019s level of income lol",
    "No one's saying she deserves more pay than a nurse, but the art she creates makes a ton of money for the record labels she works for. \n\nDo you think the record labels should just steal all the money and leave her with less than a nurse because \"That's all she deserves\"? Why does the record label deserve more than a nurse? \n\nNurses deserve way more pay but people who do work that creates lots of money will always earn more because that's the nature of money",
    "Yeah, and that's really shitty. It shouldn't depend on if you get a good boss or not.  A lot of places here offer extra leave too, including where I work.  But yeah that's the minimum required by law for a full time worker. \n\nWe have alot of contractors too but they are still covered by our health system. They need to make sure that what they're getting paid covers allowing for holidays, taxes, etc.  and contracting is predominately used by professionals in either trades or the govt. So big enough money, not a struggling musician. \n\nThe system in my country is by no means perfect but it certainly doesn't feel as rigged and warped as the American system (yet, the rot is spreading - we've got a dropkick coalition of chaos atm ourselves)"
