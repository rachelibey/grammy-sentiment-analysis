    "Because we have our own rap scene, it is significantly harder for US rappers to chart well over here without pandering to us. Look at Drake as an example, his only songs that charted really well were with Rihanna, who the UK loves, or more dance focused stuff like Hold On We're Going Home, until he reworked an old UK dance track for One Dance and topped the charts for 15 weeks. And then the mixtape after that was explicitly made to appeal to the UK in both it's sounds and it's features, and funnily enough he charted most songs from the album. And then following the 1-2 pinch of God's Plan and Nice For What, the former released whilst he was promoting over here a lot and the latter just appealing to our tastes, people just sort of clicked with him and he started regularly charting well on his own\n\nThen compare to Kendrick. His music doesn't, and never has, particularly appeal to UK tastes, and as such his biggest songs have been pop collaborations until now",
    "In the past he would\u2019ve been top 10 lol",
    ">Say Drake listeners, why did one of his songs even make the top 20??\n\nThis...makes no sense????? How is this a dig towards Drake?   \n  \nAccording to the internet Kendrick killed Drake's career but the second he dropped an album everyone is buying it to the point where it's outranking GNX and a random album track is charting higher for sales than Not Like Us.",
    "Labels obviously push stuff but I think when something is already popular amongst so many people at one time the algorithms recommend it more.",
    "Oh my god a label is pushing n promoting their hit song ..what a shocker that is..shut up man...even espresso was recommended to us when we didn't even listen to sabrina",
    "Yall are so dumb omg. Spotify works that way for EVERY big song. They recommend and \"autoplay\" songs that people actually listen to. All of the biggest songs recently were pushed BECAUSE they already were the biggest songs. Yall don't get algorithms it's actually sad",
    "So pop music is short for popular music, and this is the most popular song in the country this week.",
    "I would guess that the Super Bowl halftime show gets easily 10x the number of viewers in the UK as the actual Super Bowl does - just by the nature of sharing a single internet it gets a big push.",
    "Born Again needs to be higher wtf it\u2019s such a UK sounding hit esp with Raye in it",
    "Eminem and 50 Cent are actually pretty popular there. Both of them still have albums charting there.",
    "I'm not even a Drake fan but the cringey glazing people have over Kendrick is insane and a major turn off. According to the internet Drake is supposed to be dead and have no career but the second he dropped a new album it started outselling GNX and a random album track starts outpacing Not Like Us. In addition to him selling out arenas. \ud83d\udc80\n\nOne reason why stan twitter is such a useless indicator of success and the users have no sense of reality or impact on the music industry because they're always so off",
    "That was a dig against his fans streaming it because it's not that good. I guess we'll see if it has any legs going forward. Yes, I am a certified Drake hater. I was a casual listener during the early to mid-2010s. And nothing has grabbed me from his recent releases!\n\nI also haven't seen any of my friends blasting his songs, except Rich Baby Daddy for a brief second.\n\nObviously, Drake still has fans and there are people in the GP who don't know or care about the beef. He still pulls crazy streaming numbers, but the ass whooping he got after NLU was so embarrassing, I'm surprised he's still showing his face in public!! Hearing tens of thousands of people scream \"A MINOOORRRRR\" at both the Super Bowl and the Grammys has to sting!\n\nThe first week sales from this album is still worse than his other projects and likely won't make much of an impact going forward so maybe think about the facts of NLU's success almost a year later!",
    "True, NLU really \u201ccrossed over\u201d past the beef more than euphoria which is weird to say since hip hop has always been big but it\u2019s one of those songs that people who literally NEVER listened to the genre prolly know a line or 2 (HUMBLE was also similar)",
    "I love Kendrick but you have to be blind to not see that Not Like Us is being shoved everywhere\u00a0",
    "The biggest songs become the biggest songs because they are pushed. It's been this way since the first days of radio. The comment was not about why big songs pop up constantly on the algorithm, but about the reticence/denial of fans online to give credit business choices for a song's popularity because they feel doing so \"cheapens\" the impact of said art pieces. The good ol' art vs business debate in fan spaces that doesn't allow the truth of the two of them being intrinsically linked to each other to be acknowledged.",
    "Never said it was unique. Just that some people  have gotten overly sensitive about the song's success, especially after Drake's bogus lawsuit, that they find the idea of NLU being anything but a fanmade success story irks them. No hit song is fully \"chosen by the people\". No hit song is fully a fanmade success story. It doesn't take away from the artistry or the song's popularity/impact, and it's weird to see fandoms act like it does when it's just the rules of the game.",
    "You know the Super Bowl is a global event right? It is broadcast to 190 countries. \n\nOver 4 million people watched it in the UK this year.",
    "Oh my bad, I completely missed that",
    "There are a few exceptions - as someone else mentioned as well as Eminem there's 50 Cent, but also Kanye, I'm sure there's a couple others too. British rap/hip-hop is what is popular (and for what it's worth is mostly dominated by non-white artists), as I said I think because the genre tends to have more of a tight cultural appeal rather than appealing to the widest possible audience like a lot of pop/rock.",
    "They have nothing other than trying to be morally superior than everyone.",
    "Obviously Drake isn't dead and he is still going to sell well. But recently Kendrick has definitely outsold them. \n\nYou realize that Drake's album released last week and Kendrick's album is months old and Not like Us is 9 months old.",
    "> Drake is supposed to be dead and have no career\n\nShow me 1 person that said this. You are literally making up people to be mad at.",
    "That\u2019s not true for me at all!\u00a0Espresso as well as Lunch were played for me on non pop playlists just as much lol",
    "Ah I'm sorry I didn't realize that this didn't fully concern your original comment. It's just people in the replies are making me mad because they're saying that Not like us (and many hits) aren't actual hits since they're being \"shoved down our throats\" by the algorithm. Which is just false because the algorithm only pushes songs that are already big, that's how it works.\n\nBut yes, obviously songs get big because their label pushes them. That's why music videos and the radios exist. However I'd say that with \"not like us\" it was initially big the second it dropped due to the beef lol. But the label push obviously made it even bigger than before so that almost everyone actually knows the song now.",
    "> No hit song is \u201cchosen by the people\u201d. No hit song is fully a fanmade success story.\n\nI completely disagree with these statements. Major Labels use payola literally all the time to push every single big new song from every single big new artist. And yet many of those songs do not become hits. \n\nTyler the Creator has an 8 year old song that is higher on the Spotify charts than a brand new Tate McRae single that is being pushed heavily by her label. The people chose that Tyler song as a hit, almost a decade after it came out. \n\nDoechii has a 6 month old, old school hip hop style storytelling song about depression and drug abuse with no hook that is being streamed more than a brand new Lady Gaga pop song.",
    "Yes, people in my country have been wondering for years now about Taylor Swift just because her songs are not that suitable for a top-40 radio full of eurodance and edm-adjacent pop hits. The same with hip-hop (the biggest foreign hip-hop song of 2024 here was Houdini by Eminem, which popularity was pretty much based on his legacy)",
    "50 is associated with Eminem which is part of it imo, Kanye yeah he was super super popular, his music had super widespread appeal.\n\nThe British rap thing is true.",
    "Damn and what you never did something stupid at 20? Man go get angry at a real problem",
    "Lmao pop heads just downvoting every comment that doesn't dickride Kendrick. I'm not even a Drake fan, but this shit is hilarious. The hive mentality is insane.",
    "You\u2019re gonna suffer saying shit like that in this sub. This a Kendrick dickriders club only",
    "If you click on the same link, NOKIA is only doing better on iTunes where more people are purchasing it. But if you check the same charts for Apple Music and Spotify, Not Like Us is doing much better! \n\nGNX is a highly lauded album by critics AND fans and the streams reflect that. More people have been introduced to the album through the Super Bowl than when it was first released!!\n\nKendrick had 2 solo #1s and 1 as part of the Metro Boomin and Future song Like That last year. You know how many Drake had?? 0\n\nI think the only cringy fanbase here is Drizzy's. JFC",
    "Do they promote it because its a big song, or is it a big song because they promote it? \ud83e\udd14 Why would a big song need to be promoted",
    "On occasion, you have those types of success stories, and they're a beautiful exception to rule. But they are exceedingly rare, and for a reason.",
    "Honestly it\u2019s totally fine to not like Drake but it\u2019s getting kinda cult-y when every comment not in praise of Kendrick is met with anger or downvotes. The beef made people in this sub weird\u00a0",
    "> Nokia is outperforming Not Like Us on iTunes\n\nITunes is a platform where you buy the song once and then don't have to buy it again. A song that is ~9 months old and sold a lot when it released should absolutely have less sales right now than something brand new, that's just how it works\n\nEdit: they responded to me, and then I assume blocked me? I'll quote their comment and respond here\n\n>Considering sales matter more than streams for chart placement, L take\n\nYou get that this just makes Kendrick look more impressive, right? Drake is doing better in the dominant metric for charting and yet his placement is significantly lower on the chart - so Kendrick must clearly be absolutely dominating streaming. Just goes to show that cherry picking a single stat doesn't matter much in an argument if you aren't looking at the bigger picture\n\n> It being brand new doesn't matter considering it just had back to back Grammys + Superbowl performance in like less than a month which increased its popularity like never before. Also contradicted how there've been multiple works that range from being several months old to several years old that have been in the top 20 for multiple weeks.\n\nSo there's two things here. Firstly, the Grammy's didn't have much of an effect on his chart placement, but the Superbowl did, probably because it was a big performance that was viewed by millions in the UK, unlike the Grammy's that isn't shown in the UK for some reason. \n\nSecondly, and more importantly, songs tend to have one peak in their sales in the digital era. You buy the mp3 (or whatever the apple equivalent is) when the song is popular and then you have it forever, you don't re-buy it. That happened for Kendrick 9 months ago. You mention songs from a few years ago, I assume you mean Pink Pony Club that's getting it's main push now, and songs from 20 years ago, which are pretty damn irrelevant given that there's been a whole new generation since then that haven't bought the songs and those that did at the time would have bought them physically which is much easier to lose, meaning they can have a second wave. Drake's single now is having it's wave at release, as most songs do - you would expect that wave, from a large star, to be bigger than songs that have already had their waves, including Kendrick's \n\n> Stan culture really is just brain rot\n\nThat really does seem to be the case, huh?",
    "Headline? Show me 1 news headline that said this lmao. That\u2019s absurd. \n\n> \u201cKendrick just killed Drake\u201d\n\nYes\u2026..in the rap battle. Interpreting people saying that as, \u201cKendrick has now ended Drake\u2019s career forever. He is officially banned by the world\u2019s governments of ever making music again.\u201d is a ridiculous way to take that.",
    "If you think Not Like Us only became a hit because of inorganic push, you need to get outside more. I\u2019ve never seen a song be so well liked everywhere I go like it has. It was actually shocking. \n\nI\u2019ve seen people going crazy over it when it plays in hipster cafes at 11AM, at baseball games, when it was just playing on house speakers before a concert I went to for a white indie rock band, and it doesn\u2019t matter how many times it comes on at a club, everyone still goes completely crazy for it when it plays, even 9 months after it came out. \n\nThere were kids in remote villages across the world making dance videos to it. It was playing at weddings in India.\n\nGo on the Spotify charts and click on a random country: it\u2019ll be all songs of artists from that country\u2026\u2026plus Not Like Us. \n\nThe song is a true global phenomenon crossing race, ethnicity, age, and nationality borders.",
    "I dont even know what to say to you... why do you think labels pay for payola ????? Not like us became an instant hit after it came out ...then the label just boosted the song with payola and by promoting it everywhere that's what they do with a big song",
    "Bro, DJs were playing that shit in the club the *instant* it came out. They didn\u2019t have to be paid, they just lived through one of the craziest 24 hours in rap history and knew this shit was a hit the moment they heard it",
    "They are \u201cexceedingly rare\u201d, and yet I just gave you two examples that are literally happening right now lmao",
    "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve never done anything wrong ever in your life",
    "I like hip hop, R&B, and pop, but I was mostly just a casual listener of both Drake and Kendrick.\n\nThis beef was so annoying because of the insane hypocrisy involved. Kendrick said that Iggy fucking Azalea and her weird, fake Southern blaccent had a place in hip hop, but that Drake is a colonizer...even though his dad is Black American and his uncle is part of Black American music royalty. Or supporting abusers like Dr. Dre, who got a woman pregnant when she was 16, while calling Drake a pdf based on the kind of innuendo that would apply to all of male hip hop.\n\nHonestly, it made me look at Kendrick a little different especially since idiots online were turning this into some kind of movement for \"the culture,\" when to me, he just came across as a dude who envied Drake\u2019s success, while too online FBA xenophobes were just pissed Jimmy from Degrassi became the biggest artist in hip hop. There I said it lol.",

    "Yeah, those two examples are a perfect example of the rarity of this phenomenon. You have something like that now, you won't have it again for a good while.\n\nAnd even those songs aren't exactly setting official country charts on fire (Billboard, UKSC, etc) or saturating pop culture, which is still the metric for real success. Spotify numbers are all but one drop in an ocean of ever expanding categories that are counted to quantify popularity.",
    "> Explain how NLU goes #1 after the Super Bowl \n\nIf someone needs to explain to you how this happened\u2026..lmao \n\n> then suddenly after it goes #1, Luther surges past it to add another #1?\n\nBecause Not Like Us is a 9 month old song, and Luther was already a top 3 charting active hit song on Billboard the week right before the Super Bowl? Like it\u2019s not that hard to understand lmao. You realize Luther already almost went #1 multiple times in 2025 before the Super Bowl, right?",
    "Canadians don't dickride Drake at all. He's always been hated hard in Canada. Canadians have actually been mocking him this whole beef and dickriding Kendrick. Only his Canadian fans love him. I've personally NEVER been a Drake supporter. I don't like people just because they're Canadian lol. Thanks for creeping through my profile and comment history, though.\n\nRap is an *extremely* competitive genre. If you don't think hip hop artists, including Kendrick and Drake, envy each other's success, especially those on top, you're deluded.\n\nBtw, thanks for completely avoiding the topic about the hypocrisy in this beef. Not shocking at all.",
    "But that directly contradicts what was just said. And it still applies to Not Like Us' popularity as well. Lola Young's *Messy* got popular months after it was released in the US. \n\nIt's really not that rare. The notion that songs only can get popular within the week of its release is false. Other factors can 'bring it back to life' or make it more popular than it ever was before.",
    "I have mentioned Kendrick being hypocritical myself before I think it\u2019s a fair point. \n\nThe people I know that lived in Canada spoke about how much people love him and Canadians I know love him too but maybe that\u2019s selective and they\u2019re all speaking about Toronto basically.\n\nDrake definitely envies Kendrick\u2019s critical acclaim which is part of it, Kendrick just doesn\u2019t envy drakes popularity I don\u2019t know how you can come to that conclusion. Kendrick stays off social media, he doesn\u2019t release music constantly like drake, he makes things that aren\u2019t what\u2019s typically popular. \n\n\nAfter DAMN when he could have gone really commercial and was at his highest he then went away for ages and released an album with no singles that was a personal album with little mainstream appeal, about personal growth and coming to terms with things and mistakes in his life etc. \n\nIf he wanted to be more popular he would be, not everyone wants to be Drake, Kendrick is a popular artist who also has artistic merit that\u2019s what he wants to be not Drake.",

    "I\u2019ve been watching Pink Pony Club\u2019s streams and the views on YouTube slowly rise and I love that the song that got her dropped by the label is finally (!!!) having its moment.\n\nJust pure \u201cfuck you\u201d energy paying off \ud83d\ude42\u200d\u2195\ufe0f",
    "Having a brilliant awards speech boosted her for sure.",
    "I mean, the wording in this case is kind of weird, but I actually think it\u2019s pretty significant that there have been a couple cases of this song just going in the natural order that many other songs do in dying down in popularity, but then because of how culturally significant it is, it\u2019s rebounding many times not even within a year of it coming out.",
    "She got that Todd in the Shadows boost, I'm sure of it",
    "When GNX came out he also took up the whole top 5 and I think 8 places of the top 10, if Mariah\u2019s Christmas boost didn\u2019t start he would have had 9 places of the top 10",
    "That honestly would be extremely impressive especially considering how much Drake's fanbase has been pushing his sales and inflating his streams since it was released.        \nBut even if wouldn't, they already have all the excuses and narratives prepared.      \nIt's because it had no promotion, it's because PnD was the lead artist instead of Drake, it's because Spotify is faking his numbers, it's because they are trying to hide the album on streaming services, it's because it's an RnB album, it's because Kendricks streams were botted\u2026 Basically whatever they can thunk of even though they know it's untrue.     \nThey grasp at every straw they can find only to avoid the reality that the most probable answer is that many people simply realised that Drake has been shitting out mediocre albums for over a decade and they just are fed up with it",
    "That would be a shock. I think the Drake/PND album has CDs and vinyls available first week this time around. Which typically these rap/hip hop artist never have ready at launch.",
    "if you want p.diddy jokes popheadcirclejerk is great for that",
    "I honestly think both are fine, I enjoyed both quite a bit at one point, both have kind of worn out their appeal on me (but the horns on not like us are still fire so I would def rather listen to NLU at this point) but even if you feel Bar song> NLU, surely you can acknowledge that there\u2019s logic behind why NLU is getting enough play to chart this high now while there\u2019s not really a great reason why we haven\u2019t moved onto the next Shaboozey song or other country crossover hit. We\u2019ve played tipsy into the ground imo.",
    "Yeah for all the hate TikTok gets on this sub and while it\u2019s admittedly annoying that every song is two minutes long now, I still wouldn\u2019t go back to the pre social media, total industry control era of music.\u00a0",
    "Any super streamed artist will never lose streams. Drake can\u2019t even get a top forty single since he\u2019s released a bunch of singles that didn\u2019t do so hot.",
    "They\u2019re ticked off that Kendrick beat MJ\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show ratings going \u201csee MJ still has it by a few points!\u201d Lol",
    "Boomers maybe but I feel like pop culture still cares about Gen X? Nirvana and Alanis Morissette just did fireaid and everyone loved it\u00a0",
    "She generates such weird discourse, more than a lot of genuinely awful people in the industry",
    "It\u2019s gone to number one three times but had a long break between each number one (two months plus between each time it went #1), it shows the song has a lot of longevity.\u00a0\n\nHoliday songs obviously do this easily because they chart every year with a big break between the last time they were #1 but it\u2019s the first non-holiday song to do this.",
    "bitch what",
    "If you missed the point, here\u2019s the explanation:\n\nThe original comment I replied to said:\n\n>Drake responding to like that verse pretty much ended his career in every way tbh. His numbers during and after the beef seems to take a big hit.\n\nFor that I replied that before, during and after the beef, Drake managed to stay the top 1 and (after Kendrick surpassed him) now top 2, which would invalidate the claim that \u201cDrake pretty much ended his career\u201d and even that \u201chis numbers (\u2026) seems to take a big hit\u201d. That\u2019s the point in bringing the fact that he was top 1 until he became top 2. It should be also noted that if we count Bad Bunny, then Drake would be the 3rd most listened.\n\nRegarding your explanation of why Drake used to sit on #1 for so long, I must say that that\u2019s irrelevant. He used to be the most streamed rapper and now he isn\u2019t, Kendrick took his spot after the beef. \n\nIt\u2019s also a bit disingenuous to claim that Drake was only #1 because of his pop songs when you check his most listened songs. It\u2019s simply not true. Unless you think Kendrick got to #1 by defeating a pop star lol\n\n>That\u2019s a major career low for Drake\n\nI guess we could say that, but the \u201cfor Drake\u201d is doing some heavy lifting here. Let\u2019s not act like being the 2nd most listened rapper in the US is anywhere close to \u201ccareer ending\u201d or \u201cbad numbers\u201d.",
    "And you know what\u2019s crazy? MJ\u2019s Super Bowl is the first time I ever remember understanding cultural moments. I was 5 and *begged* my parents to let me stay up to watch. I remember where I was in our home, even! Weirdly I don\u2019t remember if I actually got to watch, ha. So, shocker!, getting currently popular artists can actually satisfy multigenerational viewers.",
    "Yeah, they dropped her shortly after releasing it in 2020. It was her first song with a new sound, also her first working with Daniel Nigro (Olivia\u2019s producer)\n\nThey felt she wasn\u2019t marketable enough and basically gave up on her after several EPs under that contract. She was barely getting by before Good Luck, Babe blew up. Now people are finally hearing the talent, we love to see it",
    "She has the classic problem of a small, yet LOUDLY, obnoxious, entitled, \u201cthis music isn\u2019t for YOU\u201d, fanbase that dominates Twitter.",
    "Here is a pretty niche UK chart fact for you then. In the UK an Australian act impersonating Italian music has gone to number one and has blocked a song that would go on to outsell it twice. Suddapa you face blocked Vienna by ultravox, and We No Speak Americano blocked Love The Way You Lie. Both songs they blocked were higher on the year end charts with Eminem being the best performing song of the year.",
    "He reminded Americans how awful homophobia is so they\u2019re all streaming Pink Pony Club and dreaming of escaping this awful mess.",
    "i think it will definitely hit top 10 when the album drops and may surge even higher after an SNL performance/other promo",
    "There's a double standard going on here if your pointed needed a doubling down on explanation to show how it still can apply but my point about the reading of those metrics can be quickly dismissed as \"irrelevant\".\n\nAlso Kendrick did go to #1 by defeating a pop star. That's the whole thing. Considering Drake more of a pop star than a rapper is not an uncommon perspective. The hip hop community has been pointing this out for a long time. \"I like Drake with the melodies\" wasn't about his rapping. Many of his biggest hits are not rap.\n\nDrake's entire gamble was that this beef would not affect him or his numbers, and that Kendrick would never match them. He said this directly in his opening salvo. Even if we want to look at numbers objectively, it's clear Drake himself doesn't. He put a lot of pride and braggadocio into his numbers. Him getting dethroned is a huge personal career low for him. Yes, it's not far to say his career is dead or limping but we can't ignore that he never thought this would ever happen to him as recently as last spring.",
    "Yeah I was at my brother\u2019s apartment when MJ\u2019s Super Bowl performance came on. It was allowed lol",
    "I\u2019m just saying Gen X isn\u2019t culturally irrelevant the way boomers are yet like the comment claimed.\n\nI think it was mostly boomers though. At any rate my Gen X parents liked the performance and Kendrick being in with Dr Dre and paying homage to Pac constantly seems to buy him some grace with that generation lmao",
    "Clearly it's because of Todd in the Shadows ranking it the best of 2024",
    "But this isn\u2019t twitter - this is Reddit and the comments on any post about her are just atrocious. I agree with AigisAegis - she\u2019s a vocal lesbian and that doesn\u2019t fit the pop girlie mold for many.",
    "my favorite chappell roan fan tic is that anyone saying good luck babe is kinda biphobic gets accused of \"lesbophobia\"",
    "With how huge Eminem is in the UK I\u2019m surprised Love the Way You Lie wasn\u2019t a #1",
    "Old asf lmfao\u00a0",
    "I think we all need to go outside and enjoy the sunshine",
    "Queer /= free from misogyny. This is completely anecdotal but all my gay male friends irl hate her and are vocal about it. Blaming her for the election loss, etc etc. I unsubbed from popculturechat because of how they talked about a woman brand new to stardom. This is not a safe space either but at least there is more real discussion.",
    "This right here. Being from the south, it\u2019s insane how out of touch coastal liberals are. Like yes I am indeed progressive, but I also understand why half of my family is disillusioned by the democrats. I have dealt with these kinds of people my entire life, was raised by them, went through natural disasters with them \u2014 I see them as human beings with their own experiences that led them here today. \n\nI\u2019ve tried the no contact thing, but the real way to change people\u2019s minds is through their hearts. Showing empathy for the other side can only result in a net positive for society. Note: That doesn\u2019t mean rolling over and not calling them out when they\u2019re clearly in the wrong.",
    "i dont understand how she gets hate for the election, if taylor who is the biggest celebrity in the US couldn't help then i doubt what chappell said made any difference",
    "when your state\u2019s been sending billions of dollars of aid for decades towards the south only to have those folks turn around and say we deserve to burn in hell in our wildfires, it\u2019s pretty fucking frustrating",
    "This is cool and all but as somebody who is from a similar area as you I am transgender so I don't really get to just change my family and community's mind through their hearts they just hate me for no reason\n\nNuance is important, and this sort of lionizing rural America is not actually better than demonizing it. Red states contain a lot of people just living their lives, and a lot of people who are justifiably disillusioned with a broken system. And they also contain a lot of horrible, hateful people who genuinely do just want bad things for bad reasons. And the latter are not a minority! They're a huge part of the population, and *you have to deal with that*. You don't get to just ignore them and act like everybody in every red state is one of those innocent disillusioned folk\n\nOr I guess you do get to just ignore them. But again, I'm trans, so I super don't!",
    "I get it, I moved to California. \n\nPeople in red states see you as the pretentious elites who hoard money and buy up all of our cheap real estate. They either don\u2019t realize or choose to ignore that there are working class people like them in the expensive blue states.\n\nIt makes no sense why they think a handful of billionaires are totally fine, but alas, I\u2019m not here to defend their views. I\u2019m just saying they are people, and people can change if you act as an example and don\u2019t just cut them off.",
    "Good thing I clearly said in this thread that there\u2019s a difference between harmful people and those who are open to discussion. \n\nYou are preaching to the choir. You\u2019re also proving my point for why we need to change our messaging and communication strategy to win America back. \n\nDo whatever you feel is best for you and your community, more power to you. And I\u2019ll continue doing what is best for mine.",
    "Sooooo... this is a BIG week! We're celebrating **400 WEEKS** of the popheads charts! I have a few big stat overviews, but first let's get started with this week's takeways:\n\n* **'Abracadabra'** has managed to pull a real magic trick and chart with MORE points this week than it did in it's debut! With 9249.5 points, it overtakes Rain on Me to become not only Gaga's biggest song, but the 9th most points any song has recieved in the charts history (Which places it just above Olivia Rodrigo's **'Vampire'** (9127.5 points) and just below Charli XCX's **'Sympathy is a Knife featuring ariana grande'** (9369.0))\n\n* **'Good Luck, Babe!'** charts at #25 this week, which brings it up to a **record-breaking** 45 consecutive weeks on the popheads charts!! Chappell takes the record from herself, beating the impressive 44 week streak Red Wine Supernova managed to hold (a track which also managed to chart this week at #41). **'Pink Pony Club'**'s re-entry at #7 is ALSO a new peak for the song!\n\n* That's not the only track growing an impressive streak however, as this week brings Charli XCX's **'360'** streak up to 40 weeks, tying it with Taylor Swift's **'Delicate'**. And only one week behind that is Billie Eilish's **'BIRDS OF A FEATHER'**, tying yet another Taylor Swift song **'Cruel Summer'** at 39 weeks. All of these massive hits show no signs of slowing down, so who knows how far these streaks will go!\n \n* The big album bomb this week was Oklou's debut album *choke enough*, which charted 11 of it's 13 tracks on the chart. Oklou had previously charted 3 different songs, but ict and Blade Bird mark her first entries in the Top 10! The biggest debut song this week is the triple threat **'Born Again'** with LISA, Raye and Doja Cat, with the only other debut this week being Ava Max's **'LOST YOUR FAITH'** at #42. Additionaly, thanks to a feature on Oklou's **'Harvest Sky'**, Underscores gains her first entry in the popheads chart this week, at a respectable #24.\n\n* Thanks to the continual charting of **'Espresso'** and **'Taste'**, Sabrina Carpenter has been on the chart for 44 consecutive weeks this week (from April 29th, 2024) tying her with Olivia Rodrigo's (lol) previous best streak from January 18th, 2021 - November 15th, 2021 (between **'drivers license'**, **'deja vu'** and **'good 4 u'**). Chappell Roan still maintains her top spot in this statistic however, with her current streak of 65 weeks starting from November 27th, 2023 with **'Red Wine Supernova'**, and **'Good Luck, Babe!'** helping to maintain this mammoth run.",

    "Well deserved win for Gaga here Abracadabra is one of the best pop songs I have heard in a very long time. Disease is also damn good and might even be better, this album is shaping up to be one of her best if not her best ever.",
    "Damn this is probably the superbowl that has impacted the charts the most overall... honestly kendrick is amazing and totally deserves this. 3 albums in the top 10!!! I'm excited to see how he does on the Hot 100",
    "Ridin in my GNX wit Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon be a sweet love",
    "GNX is great, as well as Hurry Up Tomorrow. Genuinely enjoying a lot of recent releases",
    "I\u2019ve had GNX on repeat since the Super Bowl dropped. I really enjoyed it when it dropped, but had moved on to more recent releases\u2026but now I\u2019m fully back in committed to hearing GNX daily. lol",
    "I\u2019ve been listening to GNX and a Luther Vandross best of list!(thx Kendrick)",
    "Love this for Kendrick and realllllly love this for all of the \"who? Rap isnt music\" people when he was announced for halftime",
    "I love that Kendrick didn\u2019t even perform any *good kid, m.A.A.d city* songs at the Super Bowl but enough people were like \u201cDamn, he killed it at the Super Bowl! I\u2019m gonna listen to the classics again\u201d to get it back into the top 10.",
    "Damn Weeknd had like an 80% drop but still did over 100K. That shows that people are still consistently listening to the album because just his streaming numbers last week was 131K, I think it\u2019s gonna have some staying power. \n\nKendrick is on insane run, I wonder if literally all his albums will be on the billboard 200 this week.",
    "well good for him\n\nlove the top 10 albums this week\n\nw!!!",
    "I think this is indeed true. I don\u2019t remember a recent Super Bowl creating such a surge up the charts like Kendrick\u2019s. It\u2019s typically one or two songs from the set that make a reappearance.",
    "I love that true artistry is back to the forefront",
    "r/KendrickLamar is encouraging everybody to stream Sabrina, lol",
    "\"oh yeah, by the way, heres another surprise album\" -Kdot potentially \ud83d\ude06",
    "Looking pretty likely that GNX will surpass Drake\u2019s new project in daily streams either today or tomorrow. But unless Drake\u2019s album continues to see huge drops daily, it will end the week with more streams overall",
    "Drake fans are for sure mobilized and it is a great strategic move to release the album when he did. The beef benefits both teams and the industry A LOT.",
    "I think it\u2019s because these songs were already charting as hit songs even before the performance. So you\u2019re getting the usual Super Bowl boost, but on top of already current smash hits. So they\u2019re going super saiyan. \n\nIt\u2019s beautiful to watch. I don\u2019t care how corny it is to say, but this is such a win for true artistry, culture, and morals/values. \n\nHis music is just so true to the art form of hip hop, so full of good-hearted messaging and themes (especially Mr Morale), it\u2019s so inspiring to see that win commercially over the microwaved McDonald\u2019s, hedonistic, misogynistic, narcissistic, vapid, bland music that Drake has been running the charts with over the last 8 years. \n\nWhat\u2019s happening in the country is so fucked right now, but the zeitgeist/pop culture choosing the introspective, good-natured, true art rapper over the incumbent narcissist, creatively bankrupt, self-obsessed rapper who pushes gambling and misogyny to kids gives me hope that things can get better again.",
    "most of the set list was off of GNX and all the stars was already getting renewed attention on streaming (kinda like with Tyler\u2019s see you again out streaming most of chromakopia 8 years after it was already a hit for pretty much no reason)\n\nbut it\u2019s still impressive that money trees is charting and gkmc got up here when he didn\u2019t perform anything off that album",
    "May you elaborate on this please? I'm curious as to what you mean.\u00a0",
    "That is crazy. I saw the (+17) and did a double take. Super impressive.",
    "That's even funnier, 1 billion people just heard Kendrick's diss track against Drake, literally almost a quarter of this planet just heard the line \"Say Drake, I heard you like them young\" and \"A minor\"",
    "True but it says streaming brought in 117k sales meaning he would still by #1 without any physical sales, which is honestly even crazier.",
    "Ah yes. It's nice to see those with the resources and room to leave out some effort, like Kendrick, deliver projects with extra love and care for their craft. Like look at his music videos too for this era. Really cool stuff\u00a0",
    "I wasn't being sarcastic but holy shit now I can't unsee it haha\u00a0",

    "This week was really interesting to watch. You had Chappell and Gaga still running high off the grammys, looking maybe to take the top spot, then Kendrick out of nowhere threatened. None quite being able to reach Lola. Next week will possibly be even more interesting. Messy is having its moment but now it goes up against two artists who've combined for nearly a year atop the singles chart in their career in Drake and Sabrina Carpenter, the 8th and 16th most prolific artists in UK history in terms of weeks on top. Shall be a fun week.",
    "I haven\u2019t been interested in following the charts in such a long time! Admittedly it\u2019s cause I\u2019m a huge Gaga fan but it\u2019s been a genuinely interesting week",
    "Another top 5 for chappel! And doechii has a top 10! And UK giving All the Stars its stars \u2728 love to see it",
    "How is TDE so good at getting new talent? They honestly seemed like they were kinda screwed after Kendrick left",
    "Kendrick still number one on Spotify and downloads today. I hope it goes number one in the UK I love seeing the people stuck in the 70s and 80s have a meltdown on Facebook.",
    "I\u2019m always surprised by how well Tate McRae\u2019s songs do in the UK. Her sound is just so AMERICAN to me (yes, I know she\u2019s Canadian) so it\u2019s really surprising that her music is bigger in the UK than in the US!",
    "Pretty good actually",
    "Yeah it was just edging into the top 40 a few weeks ago, it\u2019s had an amazing rise",
    "I mean her sound is pure pop, which has always been super popular in the UK",
    "this is so smart and cool!!! hope they keep it forward for all future halftime shows/pre game performers like national anthem",
    "Probably a label/licensing/legal issue of some kind",
    "Perfect time for tickets to go on sale",
    "I don\u2019t have the money to go but I love the poster!",
    "This is gonna be a great show! In terms of male rappers, I can\u2019t think of anyone who puts on a better show than Kendrick. I saw SZA during her SOS tour, and I was pleasantly surprised!",
    "Damn stadiums in the UK too, that\u2019s wild, and I wonder if either of them are planning UK/EU festival dates as it\u2019s during festival season",
    "Begging them to put on a Manchester OR Liverpool date, would be so much more ideal for me\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",
