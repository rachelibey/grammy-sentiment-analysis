    "VH1 India broadcasts Shaboozey's \"A Bar Song\" in a state which scrubs every mention of Jack Daniel's from the song.\n\nOnly, they don't do so by dipping the vocals, retaining the instrumental. Nor do they even go the lazy route and reverse the audio (as such channels as the now-defunct 4Music would be prone to doing).\n\n  \nTHEY TAKE THE EVEN LAZIER ROUTE AND MUTE THE WHOLE DAMN THING.\n\n  \nLeaving. Nothing. But. Dead. Air.\n\n  \nAnd I find it absolutely, gut-bustingly hilarious.",
    "Shaboozey? His most popular song is a cover."
