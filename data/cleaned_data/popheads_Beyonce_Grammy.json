    "Yay Ive been waiting for this one!! Stream TGI!!!",
    "Ahh yes, Pitchfork and Fantanos favorite album! It is a damn good album though that I think most people liked.",
    "I was so excited for this album and it did not disappoint. A masterpiece and imo her best album Fave songs are Ego, Panic Attack, Lucky, Lonely is the Muse, etc etc. pretty much the entire album lol",
    "a really beautiful album that kind of demands to be listened to front-to-back. one that has different nuances to be appreciated with every listen. its impressive to last 18 tracks and not really feel overlong at any point! and im not usually an invested halsey fan, although i think shes sort of underrated in the pop sphere. she has a handful of really great songs from every album. what i love most about *this* album, though, is that it throws everything at the wall and somehow makes it all stick; its a real collage of different styles and subjects, all tied together by halsey as its narrator and protagonist. its cool to have an album with so many musical styles feel completely cohesive entirely through the strength of the songwriting. none of the songs really feel like throwaways; theyre important to the story! i dont think its a perfect album, but its one thats worth hearing and i think thats why the critical reception frustrated me so much. by reducing the great impersonator to a failed pseudo-cover album, you miss out on a project that has so much soul and purpose. id really recommend only living girl in LA, ego, i never loved you, lonely is the muse, arsonist, and the letters to god to any fan of female songwriters.",
    "My personal album of the year for sure. This was a really great write-up that went deep into Halsey's whole career, which I appreciate! I saw a lot of people checking her out for the first time this era because they liked the promo. I don't know that it's my personal favorite of theirs, but it's raw and interesting, sometimes inspiring, sometimes heartbreaking. A really great addition to her discography even if not the easiest or most \"fun.\" Shout out to my fave tracks. I like loud, catchy hooks, so I mostly gravitate toward songs like Ego and Panic Attack. However, the one that keeps hitting me and that I had on repeat was actually Hometown. This seems to be everyone's least favorite, and I think a lot of people just don't like the country style, which is causing them to miss the point. (Ignoring for a second that Halsey has done country well before, with You Should Be Sad and Finally // Beautiful Stranger, but anyway.) Hometown adds another angle to the theme of contemplating her mortality that we see throughout the album. By talking about her friends who died at 17, she is imagining a reality where she had died young too. It's super poignant and makes me think back to my own teenage years and the classmates who left us too soon. Since you mentioned *Blackstar*, another album where the artist writes about facing death is Warren Zevon's *The Wind*. He wrote it after he decided not to continue his treatment for lung cancer, and it's a beautiful look back at his life as well as a goodbye to those he loved. Unfortunately many people will never take H as seriously as Bowie or Zevon, but the fact that they're being mentioned in the same breath is not nothing.",
    "One of her most raw albums. I listened nonstop and then had to quit because it's so depressing  . Love her.",
    "Such a great writeup, OP! I was looking forward to this album all year. While I wish it had received more critical and commercial success, I loved it, and it was top ten for me easily. My favorite tracks were Ego, Lonely Is the Muse, and The Arsonist.",
    "Great album , everyone was so hooked on the concept and the personas when it was so obvious that the concept was where does Ashley stop and Halsey begin and who am I, coupled with chronic illness",
    "It was a difficult task to follow up the visual grandiosity and rock opus feeling of If I Can't Have Love... but Halsey did the damn thing and then some providing a world in which misery, grief, illness, guilt and disillusionment are propelled up by her favorite influences and music growing up. The lyricism is RAW. I really fuck with the way that, sound-wise, she decided to do everything and try everything she had been meaning to in her career, but hadn't done so far, and basically treating this as a time capsule of her artistry. Oh and the promo campaign was extra memorable, I'll always have her Kate/Amy Lee/Bjrk/Aaliyah/David Bowie/Cher/Dolly impersonations seared into my mind! An icon.",
    "Excellent writeup. Think it was pitchfork that made that \"main character symptom\" comment in reference to Halsey singing about health issues and being scared that you might orphan your kid due to said health issues.  I'll admit, I've only listened to the album once. It's brutal given the subject and at times I found the sound switch ups messy. But I think it was a good concept album especially the obvious references with a Halsey twist. Ego and Hometown were my fave off the album.",
    "THIS WAS SUCH A GOOD ALBUM I cry every single time I listen to Hometown",
    "This album was soooo deeply personal to me that i cant find words to truly express my gratitude for its existence.",
    "Fantastic record. Panic Attack is one of the best songs of 2024. Her Vevo live set is also so beautiful",
    "Omg great write up and I love this album so much. To me its her best album to date from one of my favorite artists. This album for me personally has been a big support system as someone who had a horribly traumatic injury (Cauda Equina Syndrome) that turned into a chronic illness due to the way it progressed in 2022 I felt this album. The feeling of shock and sadness really reminded me of some of the feeling I had when dealing with the aftermath. It was nice to feel seen bc while what Halsey and I went through are VERY different it still felt so important to me. Legit not a bad song imo. My top five tracks: Life Of A Spider, I Never Loved You, Lonely is the Muse, Hometown, Darwinism and The End. (But this was incredibly hard for me).",
    "This is definitely my favorite album of 2024. Absolutely obsessed from the second it dropped. Her music is so underrated",
    "Hope I was able to do it justice. Top 5 from last year easily.",
    "Fantano's main character syndrome comment was out of pocket but I found the album to be a mess",
    "Lonely is the Muse is really evocative to me! I actually aren't familiar with the inspiration she herself had on the track but it was inspirational to me.",
    "It was very critically successful! It has a 79 on Metacritic, 83 without the Pitchfork review. That and Fantano were outliers",
    "It was Fantano who said that I think and it was the nail in the coffin of me ever taking him seriously again. I was already getting very iffy on him but his take on this album truly was unforgivable to me and Im not some Halsey stan or anything.",
    "Love it! Thank you!!",
    "Sounds very Grunge to me! Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam elements, but adding her own flair ",
    "Interesting! The talk about Pitchfork and Fantano was so loud, I had no idea other reviews were so strong!",
    "Fantano is a bald bitch.",
    "I never really cared for his reviews, but that review was actually egregious. He didnt even try to engage with the album, like why review it at that point?",
    "Oof, yeah, I pretty much take his reviews as \"huh, this artist is gaining popularity, may check them out\" or \"didn't know they released an album\". I'm not a Halsey stan either so I did think her approach to the album was cool because she assumed you didn't know much about her, which makes the \"misinterpretation\" more egregious because she could not be more clear about her situation. Still don't trust Pitchfork though, because they're super hit or miss depending on if the reviewer actually does their homework.",
    "He not only didnt try to engage with it, he like outright slandered her over her health issues. Like thats just being a total fucking scumbag.",
    "I know, like every song mentions words like sick, doctors, treatment, die, etc. but somehow he missed allll of it",
    "I definitely dont trust Pitchfork either but like Fantano managed to be even worse. I liked the album a lot, and Ill be honest I didnt really catch the concept when I first listened to it because I hadnt read up on it at all before listening. I just liked a lot of songs regardless of them servicing the concept and was broadly familiar that she had health struggles, so I felt the emotion in the songs. I think some reviewers really zerod in on the albums concept and whether or not it was successful in executing the concept (I personally dont have a strong opinion there), but IMO a that is a limiting way of judging the album. A consideration, sure, but the songs work as songs IMO on their own and its a good album in its own right. I dont really dislike any of her music, but Im more hit or miss if her albums really capture me. But this album and especially Manic, which is a really good album to me, are the two that got my attention.",
    "I'm more familiar (and enjoyed) Tumblr era Halsey so Badlands is my fave album of hers. I'll check out Manic. I've just heard \"you should be sad\". Thanks!",
    "I'm also a Badlands girlie (Roman Holiday is my fave Halsey song) but I truly think every album is good! Manic is probably the most similar to Badlands sonically, though it dabbles more with country, hip-hop, and rock",
    "1. I think releasing Renaissance first was the right move. Dance/Club music is an easier sell to people upon a long hiatus then country. I think Cowboy Carter would have set a very polarizing tone for the 3 \"act trilogy\" where Renaissance ends up being not valued as much or paid attention to. People were even lukewarm on Renaissance the first go around until the tour dropped. That being said, the second half of CC does have more traditional Beyonc like songs. I don't think it would have flopped but I don't think people would have gotten the vision as much. 2. Yes it did. Transparently (don't kill me Beyhive) I don't love Daddy Lessons off of Lemonade and was very against Act 2 being country. I also was very lukewarm to Texas Hold 'Em and 16 carriages (though 16 carriages grew on me a ton). My opinion of it now is that I love how deep it explores the history of the genre, black country roots, and and the blend of country/r&b/Americana/hip-hop. I can play the album all the way through and enjoy the show. I am still partial to the back half but love how she took risks in the front part of the album. 3. II Hands II Heaven by far. Masterful songwriting, excellent pacing for 5.5 minute song and really strong vocal performance from Bey. It was my #1 song on my Spotify Wrapped. Second answer would be \"Just For Fun.\" 4. Honestly, I don't think I would reformat it. I think it's perfect as is. 5. I'm a Boston guy so grits aren't for me haha!",
    "To me Flamenco is definitely the most underrated song. The amount of people that just call it an \"interlude\" and pay it no mind just because it's a shorter song... straight to jail. That song is top tier, the lyrics are so emotional and her vocals are insane, especially in the last few runs she does, amazing amazing song that definitely does NOT get the credit it deserves.",
    "1. Obviously since the AOTY win, I noticed that the reception towards Cowboy Carter has skyrocketed. Before, ~~especially in this sub,~~ folks were saying it was a downgrade from Renaissance, and it was all over the place. I genuinely think if it came out first, the reception would have been better prior to the AOTY win. The narrative would have flowed better in her personal life since the events of the CMA performance were recent. Also, there wouldn't be many comparisons between act i and act ii, which clouded a lot of people's judgement. I think it would have sounded similar to what she released because she took a lot of care in researching her country heritage. 2. I wasn't apprehensive, but more or less interested on what she was planning to do. At first listen, I wasn't on board with it being so interlude-heavy but it took a few listens to let it click that I'm tuning into a radio show. 3. Flamenco! You can really hear the bitterness in her voice and I'm a sucker for flamenco music myself. 4. I think sequencing is fine, I would have cut a few interludes or maybe had the ending songs like Sweet/Honey/Buckin' and YA YA spread out across the album. 5. I have tried hominy grits, and I liked it.",
    "I think people would definitely been surprised if Bey was just like surprise here's a country album welcome to the new era, that being said she's always been a proud Texan and anyone who says she's not really country can kiss my grits, which to answer your question I'll eat however they're served, bless their heart For me personally I can't engage with any album this long regularly it's very overwhelming, as great as it is I just can't be like here are my highlights , but that's a me problem (Mr Krabs in therapy)",
    "(deep breath) YASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS Roxie, this writeup is so great that I'm tearing up a little bit. I think your instincts were spot-on to hold this for two days (and u/CrimsonROSET, I loved yours, too!). While I grew up in Texas, I have never really been a mainstream country fan, tending toward Lyle Lovett in my younger years and Kacey/Maren/Zach in more recent years. I had also never been a huge Bey fan, with *Renaissance* being the first truly to capture my attention thanks to gay family members and friends who connected strongly with the homage. *Cowboy Carter* grabbed me immediately and never let go, though. I don't think I listened to anything else for almost two months. I just clicked repeat and let it run (*never* shuffle). I was a top 0.1% listener on AM, thank you very much. I even became a huge Boozey fan (shameless plug: see my [writeup]( here!). I might not have even tumbled into r/popheads to the extent that I have without *CC*. All this to say, it is both an all-time great album and dear to me personally. And your writeup encapsulated so much of what is wonderful about it *perfectly*. ***THANK YOU, ROXIE!*** 1. I did not know that almost happened! I think *Renaissance* first worked best. It was a bit more Beyonc adjacent, and therefor a bit more palatable to her fans. With Act I in hand, the sharp pivot to country for Act II was almost certainly a little easier for listeners to take. 2. I was not apprehensive at all. As is probably apparent, I am all for interesting artists wading into country. The album has only gotten better and better to me. What a lovely opportunity this was today for me to listen to it again! 3. You did my beloved \"JUST FOR FUN\" wrong, just glossing over it that way! Easily my favorite track on my favorite album of the year, it would need to get *way* more attention for it not to be underrated, in my opinion. 4. Tracklist is already 10/10! No notes! 5. Creamy cheddar under Gulf shrimp sauted with garlic!",
    "I just want to say that, regarding your 16 Carriages meme, I see you and I hear you.",
    "Ii hands ii heaven is the best beyonce song ever",
    "- 1 I think the reception would have been worse, I think after renaissance the concept of the trilogy is more understood so at the very least her fans were somewhat more prepared for it. - 2 I personally was not apprehensive, I mean shes Southern and had already done Daddy Lessons showing her interest in it, and I see her as someone very free to go where her artistry takes her so it didnt feel out of left field. I cant fathom why it would be so controversial outside of the obvious. I see why she says its a Beyonc album first and foremost, it really feels like something only she could put out. - 3 Theres so many I feel considering she didnt really push out many singles and so many people seem to have dismissed it altogether. But you dont hear much about Flamenco, Tyrant, or II hands ii heaven out in the wild I feel considering how amazing they are. Outside of the two singles and Jolene I mostly hear about bodyguard, Levis jeans, and ii most wanted even on this sub. And sweet honey buckin should have been everywhere  - 4 I agree with some criticism of it being a bit bloated, I would have definitely cut out a bit in the front half or at least made the beginning pop a bit more. A lot of the slower songs I can skip are loaded in the front half so it did take me a bit to get into it. But after a while it really became my most listened to album last year. In my own personal playlist for this album I cut out my rose, daughter, smoke hour ii/just for fun, and Jolene (the production is great but I dont like the lyrics and it feels a little fast). Sorry if these cuts are blasphemous to some LOL I know Ive said it here before but I am obsessed with the final stretch beginning with the Linda Martell show. Its so creative and produced so so well. I respect Beyonc a lot but I wouldnt say I had ever spent a lot of time listening to her albums front to back, Im surprised actually that this is the one that got me hooked! So much so that I really really want to see this tour live, and Im not generally one for big concerts even if I like the artist and music. But this feels so grand and fun, while also feeling emotional And as a side note the r/ music and r/ grammys meltdowns in response to the AOTY win were unfortunately so predictable, R/music has always had such a hatred for her. Reddit in general really.",
    "1. Personally, I don't think my mental state could've handled CC in 2022, I needed the sonic antidepressant that is Renaissance. For that reason I do think Renny was better as the first release for where we were societally. But I also think it clouded people's rating of her music cause CC is just much more ambitious imo and might take a few listens to fully grasp whereas Renny was a bit more accessible such that even if you don't fully 'get it get it' you can still vibe to it but CC does kinda need you to 'get it get it' to fully appreciate it. 2. I'm at the point with Beyonce where whatever she wants to put out I will give it a chance, I was generally apprehensive of Country (though I am less so than before CC release), but I knew it was Beyonce so I wasn't worried. 3. Flamenco and Protector. I'm ready to die on the hill that CC has the best songs of her whole discography. 4. I usually have a preference for non slow songs so there was a \"lull\" that came with Alligator Tears and Just for fun that took me a bit to get used to. Still not a 100% fan of that sequencing but I'm fine with it now. I like the songs individually but in the album (esp since they come right in the middle), just oof. 5. not from the USA so never had grits, damn lol Love the album! She deconstructed Country and what it means: sonically, from a storytelling perspective, the often used motifs, gave us the origins and inspos of the genre and also what it means to \\*be\\* country and not just make country music, such a 10/10 album and if no one gets it, Beyonce I hope you know that I get it. My AOTY in a very competitive year",
    "What a fantastic piece of writing! Truly a meditation that this album deserves. Cowboy Carter was my AOTY from the day it came out, and it stayed that way. It felt so fresh and innovative while at the same time being deeply situated in the history laid out in Ameriican Requiem (and Amen, and others) and the genius that came out of that history. The intertextuality of it all through its references and features is truly a work of art, almost like a dissertation by performance. It was also one of the most fun and surprising music listening experiences I had last year. (I'm so glad I had almost no spoilers! And sorry to my neighbours for the screaming.) By the time it finished and Amen looped back into \"Nothing really ends,\" my jaw was on the floor. An instant classic, historically significant piece of Americana that I will insist to anyone who will listen should have been admitted into the Library of Congress the day it came out. I do think Cowboy Carter needed to be situated in the context of the (likely) trilogy with Renaissance being introduced first. Renaissance also met the moment in 2022 in this really essential way -- we'd all been through this great darkness (on top of all the other ongoing darkness) and to hear Beyonc putting out these dance/disco/ballroom tracks was a joy that was so deeply needed. Then by the time Cowboy Carter was introduced, we were all able to conceptualise her larger project in a much clearer way. The thesis statement of what she's *doing* when she puts out a country album and reclaims this genre is clear. As a Daddy Lessons stan from way back, I could not have been more on board the minute it was announced. For me Protector is the most underrated song on the album. And I know it's a Chuck Berry interpolation, but I really love what she did on the Oh, Louisiana transition after the freight train that is YAYA. And after all was said and done, I think 16 Carriages has stuck it out as my favourite track off the album Well done again on the write-up, I really enjoyed reading it!",
    "I will now be referring to that last section of the album (its track 21 and on for me) as the clit of the album  But to answer your first question, I dont think it would have been as well received if it was released before Renaissance. The powers that be told her that too, and I think this album was a big step for her and we all carried her with the release. She had been very busy since the release of Lemonade, with tours, albums, babies, coachella, movies, collabs.. but many people paid EiL and Black is King dust. So Renaissance was a good come back choice. But I think she also needed Renaissance to help her feel safe to release Cowboy Carter. Regarding tracks.. I really dont like dolly p/Jolene or II most wanted. I have also removed Spaghetti from my refined album playlist and the Linda Martell interlude (sorry! I just dont like how they fit). I think if she played into the radio theme once more the album would have felt more well rounded. I also grew tired of the genre trope. But overall I like the flow and the open and closing tracks make it feel almost like a book. My favourite tracks are Protector, Flamenco, Alligator Tears, Desert Eagle, II Hands II Heaven and SWEET HONEY BUCKIN. Cant comment on grits really.. not a Canadian thing. But I love polenta, so close enough.",
    "To those argue that *Cowboy Carter* isn't AOTY worthy, I would like to provide some perspective: Since its release, *Cowboy Carter* has had a profound impact on the music industry and popular culture. *Variety* noted that it might be the most discussed album of the 21st century. CNN even released a documentary, *Call Me Country: Beyonc & Nashville's Renaissance*, to explore the album's influence on country music and the presence of Black artists in the genre. The album expanded country musics reach and was hailed as a \"cultural turning point\" and a \"historic moment\" for the genre. After its release, over 36 million people listened to country music for the first time on Spotify. *The Times* observed a growing popularity of the genre in the UK, with 60% of surveyed listeners stating that *Cowboy Carter* introduced them to country music. In Sweden, the number of country music listeners increased by 60%, marking the highest rise for any music genre in the country's history. A global study also found that more than a third of Gen Z listeners became interested in country music after Beyonc's entry into the genre. On Vevo, country music video views rose by 38%, and the number of Black listeners aged 18-34 tuning into country radio increased by 40%. Beyond redefining country music, *Cowboy Carter* also created opportunities for other Black artists. NBC and *The Tennessean* stated that Beyonc proved that Black artists could reclaim their place in the genre. NPR noted that the album reflected a \"strong demand\" for country music performed by Black artists and the resurgence of a Black country music fan base that had long seemed lost. Singer Shaboozey experienced the biggest breakthrough of his career after featuring on *Cowboy Carter*. He released the single *A Bar Song (Tipsy)*, which later set a record by reaching No. 1 on the *Billboard Hot 100* for 19 weeks. Following Beyoncs *Texas Hold 'Em*, this marked the first time two consecutive Black artists topped the Hot 100. Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black country artist, saw her music streams surge by over 127,000% after appearing on the album. Other artists, including Reyna Roberts, Rissi Palmer, Tanner Adell, and K. Michelle, also experienced significant spikes in listenership. Black country music organizations, such as *Black Opry*, gained a larger following. The impact of *Cowboy Carter* received widespread praise from fellow artists and the American music industry. Stevie Wonder called it a \"masterpiece\" that is \"changing music and culture.\" Paul McCartney, Nancy Sinatra, and Linda Martell expressed their pride in being part of the album. Jon Batiste described it as \"a work of unimaginable influence,\" stating that it shattered genre boundaries. Many country music stars, including Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Brandi Carlile, Miranda Lambert, Darius Rucker, Billy Ray Cyrus, Maren Morris, and Kelsea Ballerini, applauded Beyonc for bringing country music to new audiences. Shania Twain compared Beyonc's move to the way legends like Johnny Cash once pushed genre boundaries. Carlene Carter, daughter of June Carter Cash, even declared that Beyonc deserved to be part of the Carter family for her willingness to experiment and take risks in music. Smokey Robinson praised Beyonc as one of the most talented artists in decades and commended her for writing country music in her own unique way.",
    "To answer my own question: I feel like had Cowboy Carter been her first 'mainline' release after The Gift It probably wouldn't have been as well received I think the world really did need a dance record post lockdown era and I think had she moved into country she probably would've had continued to be written on as 'legacy artist who just makes 'civil rights music'' now and proved that she still had the it factor as Beyonc that made it so people got another big era out of her, while also attracting new audiences (I did fully apply for my beyhive stan card after that album dropped after admiring and appreciating from the sidelines for years). I feel like how CC dropped first it would've boosted Ren as a 'oh thank god she's done with that phase now' dance album but in reverse I think Ren helped CC be more accepted as something new. Im unsure of who would've been featured on it, my brain goes to Kacey Musgraves on II Most Wanted instead of Miley and i have no idea who replaces Post Malone in an era where he still in his melodic hip hop bag. In a way it worked out though, in a world where it came out earlier, I dont think shaboozey has as good of a year as he had without the initial jump of off being introduced prior to us as a feature on the album",
    "Questions I feel I can answer: 1. That's assuming *Cowboy Carter* was the original title instead of \"Beyinc\" as that vinyl issue brought up. Either way, had this been released before *Renaissance*, I feel the backlash or polarization would've been worse than what she got now and would have put off a huge swath of non-Beyhive casuals from anything else. Granted, *Renaissance* would still be seen as more of an objective triumph because *and yes \"genre\" comes up but not how you think*, \"dance\" is at least forgiving as a concept and less puritanical in interpretation than \"country\" (keep in mind this album was born from the CMAs/Nashville rejecting her and \"Daddy Lessons\".) 2. The thing is, Beyonc was kind of apprehensive about the country angle...on the surface, especially with the entire \"this isn't a country album, it's a Beyonc album\" moment. There's a common thread about country music, in that some of the best is \"three chords and the truth\". The truth however is how she played into country being fundamentally black, but not being seen as such due to who's at the front of it all. I was just hoping for some songs to be good, because not a lot about country seems like it offers anything besides stylistic changes. Thankfully, despite there only being six songs I use, \"Texas Hold 'Em\", \"16 Carriages\", \"Bodyguard\", \"Jolene\", \"Protector\" and \"Daughter\", these are *career highlights*. Each of them are fundamentally Beyonc and they add just enough of country flair behind it to remind people: SHE'S FROM TEXAS! 3. Personally, both \"16 Carriages\" and \"Protector\" are the underrated songs from the album. \"Bodyguard\" just needs to be a single but that's history right there. However, \"16 Carriages\" and \"Protector\" are both two fully realized songs about her that channel \"Find Your Way Back\" from *The Gift* and \"Blue\" from S/T respectively. 16 has Beyonc reflect on her massive career and life and still *wanting* to leave a legacy even though she has...even if it meant going the country route to gain AOTY recognition. \"Protector\" has Bey at her most emotionally vulnerable about her children, as a mother or someone who can leave a legacy but without thinking about her career like on 16. She hasn't been this emotional since \"Blue\", but the difference is that \"Protector\" has craftsmanship and time behind it and not just the first time emotional reflection \"Blue\" offered. Aside from that, nicely done on the writeup.",
    "It seems like so many people online, even Beyonce fans, have accepted Cowboy Carter's Grammy wins to be a 'career win' as an apology to Beyonce for snubbing her in the past, not for the actual album released. Well, fuck that! This is genuinely my favorite album to come out last year! It genuinely feels like people have been completely unwilling to engage with this album as a piece of music instead of a cultural commentary (somewhat similar to Lemonade ... I have thoughts on that) but it is by far the most boundary-pushing any mainstream star released recently. 1. I think people put a little too much stock into the statement about Cowboy Carter being planned to release first - my interpretation is that a 'country' album was conceptualized right after the Daddy Lessons CMAs and was planned, but I doubt it was just waiting to be released until she thought of Renaissance. That said, Renaissance was a very necessary intro into this whole genre-bending 3 act project. My only comment is that Cowboy Carter would've been better received even a year or two earlier, before everybody and their mom started dabbling with country music. 2. I was fully confident after Daddy Lessons. I was actually initially disappointed that the album wasn't deep enough into country, but I've come around since then. \"This ain't a country album, this is a Beyonce album\" was more accurate than I thought it would be. Honestly, it has just as much country as Renaissance has true house music but no one seemed to complain about that. 3. Flamenco is super underrated, both as a piece of music and for its thematic significance. I think it says a lot that Flamenco was seemingly added to the album along with Spaghetti and Ya Ya - some of the most genre-bending moments were added right before release when most of the album was already done. Spaghetti makes the album's genre-breaking thesis explicit and adds a Southern rap influence; Flamenco does something similar by featuring a genre that is explicitly not American in origin - my interpretation is that this opens up the album's palette to the 'myth' of America and the West as it relates to racial nationalism: the way many racists try to claim 'western European culture' as belonging exclusively to all white people. 4. I would remove the Smoke Hours - its nice that she got Willie Nelson on board, but the 'country radio' theme doesn't come up enough times to feel well thought out. Smoke Hour II especially takes a lot of words to say nothing of note at all. I'd switch out Jolene for a different country classic cover, although I don't know which one. Also, I would move Levii's Jeans to put it right before Desert Eagle \\~\\~or just cut it entirely lol\\~\\~. I don't think this album was ever meant to win over the country music establishment or the haters. I saw someone on here describe it as 'late-stage Beyonce' and I think that puts it so well. A lot of the tendencies and motifs she's used for the last decade plus are turned up to 11 here; the album is pretty heavily back-loaded with a slow beginning; it's long and unapologetic about its length. More than anything else she's ever released, this was made for Beyonce fans above all else. Its not my personal favorite album by her, but its uniquely an album only she could make.",
    "I wonder how Beyonc feels... she probably felt so happy after being snubbed for so long in the main categories and now it's ruined as her social media has been flooded with hate. Which sucks because of the meaningful reason she even did a country album in the first place.. I think going forward she needs to start putting herself out there again. From the discourse one thing that keeps being said is \"I didn't even know she released an album\" and that's a fair judgement to make, Bey released cowboy carter early 2024 and didn't acknowledge it until the very end of the year, she didn't promote it at all or do music videos so to the general public it came out of nowhere. In Contrast Billie eilish performed it everywhere/did constant promo to in the publics eyes it felt more like an event",
    "Great write-up, and thank you so much for recognizing that Ya Ya to the end is the best part of the album. I've heard so much talk about the lead singles and the duets with Miley and Post but no one is talking about how phenomenal that whole run of songs is. Riverdance and II Hands II Heaven absolutely blew me away the first time I heard them together",
    "Fantastic write-up Roxie!! As I am reading this and commenting, I am listening through the All Stars 8 rate playlist which is [a rate that is due February 8th and full of bangers by the way, just in case anyone was wondering]( About midway through reading this, Diva came on and while that song still slaps some 16 ~~carriages~~ years later, it's truly wild to hear that and read about this cinematic country album she put out. Besides being a generational talent and a culture-defining artist for the last two decades, Beyonce's range is absurdly large. Now then. 1. Had it dropped before RENAISSANCE, Cowboy Carter would have likely been overshadowed a bit by RENAISSANCE, so I'm glad it came second in the trilogy so it gets its moment to shine. That said, I don't think I see the sound changing much in this alternate universe. Part of the glory of Cowboy Carter is how timeless it feels - there's a reason she tapped old country legends like Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton and Linda Martell, which is that sonically it feels much more of a nod to older folk-country than the modern shape country has taken. I could realistically see an older country artist singing 16 Carriages, for example; it would have been a massive sonic shift for newer country artists like Luke Combs or Megan Maroney to the point of almost feeling out-of-character (No shade to either of those artists though, just the first two I thought of off the top of my head). All that is to say, the timelessness and lack-of-trend-following that is present on Cowboy Carter makes me think it could have dropped whenever and wouldn't have had to change its sound much. 2. The album's grown on me a lot! I'll admit that at first I was a bit underwhelmed but that's mostly on me - I was excited for it because Daddy Lessons was one of my favorite tracks off Lemonade so I think I was expecting an album full of country bangers that lean more into the blues-hall feel of that track. As I listen more though, I find new things to love about it. I especially recommend putting it on when you're on a long drive on a sunny day. 3. SWEET HONEY BUCKIN. Look at that horse. Look at that horse. Look at that horse. 4. Hard to say. It does feel like it could stand to lose a couple tracks, especially in the middle. I think the interludes are great though so I wouldn't cut those at all. The only one I can think of off the top that I might cut is JOLENE, but even that has its moments (\"I know I'm a queen, Jolene / I'm still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisiana\" is one of the top five lyrics of last year). 5. Cooked in cream and loaded up with butter. Last note to any readers - if you liked this album, please do our 2024 Ultimate Rate in May where we will be pitting this against eternal sunshine and The Tortured Poet's Department ~~and everything is fine and I'm not worried about messy discourse whatsoever. :)~~",
    "Dont have much to add to the discussion, but I just wanna say II Hands II Heaven might actually be one of the best songs ever made. Everything about that song from the melodies, to the harmonies, to the atmosphere, to the beat switch-up are A1. The whole album is incredible of course but I specifically wanted to highlight this song, its truly a masterpiece!",
    "Great write up! Loved the format of it with it like the theater style! 1. I honestly think it wouldve been more of a shock. I think that with her doing the trilogy and it appearing to be of different genres it wouldve made sense but I think some fans would have been dived. 2. I was kind of Lemonade is my favorite Beyonc album but for me Daddy Lessons was my least favorite. Dont get me wrong its a great song and honestly that album has no skips but it was lower ranking. But by the time of the 16 carriages I was feeling much more confident. 3. See I think Tyrant is one of the most underrated. I also love spaghetti and feel it got left in the dust! 4. Im unsure what I would cut bc to me even if I dont like a track I can see why she added it! 5. Im not a grits eater. I wanna go on a mini side rant related to this album but I saw some guy saying Of course like I said in 2015 they would award Beyonc when she gets boring. And listen even if it wasnt your favorite from her idk how you could call the album boring . Its a very solid project!!! Favorite tracks: Aneriican Requiem, 16 carriages, bodyguard, daughter, spaghetti, YA YA and Riverdance.",
    "I absolutely love Cowboy Carter, and a year on and it is definitely the Beyonc album I listen to the most now. It is so well considered and written and explores so many genres and aspects to the country genre, and Beyoncs pride and roots in the genre. I have listened to the album so much and have spent some time thinking about how I might reformat it. I personally think Cowboy Carter has no bad songs, but 26 is a bit much and there are a few I believe could have been cut. In my reformation of the album I have removed the covers Blackbird and Jolene/Dolly P, which I do enjoy but on such a big album perhaps werent needed. I also removed Protector and Just For Fun as the album has a lot of slow ballads already, and both the Willie Nelson interludes were also cut. This makes it an even 20 songs. 1. American Requiem 2. 16 Carriages 3. My Rose 4. Texas Hold Em 5. Bodyguard 6. Alligator Tears 7. Daughter 8. Spaghetti (from here it remains unchanged) 9. II Most Wanted 10. Leviis Jeans 11. Flamenco 12. The Linda Martel Show 13. Yaya 14. Oh Louisiana 15. Desert Eagle 16. River dance 17. II Hands II Heaven 18. Tyrant 19. Sweet Honey Buckin 20. Amen If I had more power in changing the mixes of the songs, Id remove The Linda Martel Show & Oh Louisiana, but the way Yaya is produced it doesnt work on the album without those two sandwiching it. Here is a playlist Ive made on Spotify of this order, Id love to hear what people think if they agree with my order.",
    "1. I assume it would sound the same. i think she probably had these ideas already for all three but obviously makes some changes along the way (like the late addition of yaya). I think, personally, that it is better than renaissance and I think it would've still held up as better regardless of the release order - i think that i might be in the minority opinion on that overall, though. 2. i was not apprehensive. i love country (i was raised on it) and i love beyonce, so i was super excited lol. i think it's only grown on me the more i listen. 3. hmmmm maybe just for fun? it was a early standout for me but i don't really see people talk about it. the voices complement each other super well and the themes of perseverance and acceptance and healing are really well done. people can get a lot of different meaning from it. 4. I actually think it's perfect. I like the country start but then branching out into different genres after linda martell talks about what a funny concept they are. it's one of the reasons that i was hoping for the album to win AOTY. a lot of genres bleed together and a lot of albums aren't strict genre albums anymore but I do think this one is pretty unique with the mixes it has. 5. i don't i'm sorry don't hate me",
    "OP you ATE with this write-up!! ",
    "Beyonce deserves it",
    "This album is an American masterpiece",
    "1. I'm not the biggest country fan in general, but I was sure Beyonce would have a great way of making it her own. Releasing Renny ahead of time was smart. 2. As much as I enjoy it, it isn't an album I play often. I find it a little overwhelming. That said. Relistened today and I was reminded how good it is. 3. Hmm maybe My Rose? 4. It's fine as is. 5. I've only had it once, buttery and sugar. Delicious ",
    "1. Dance was def the right move for the first one of the trilogy, it was clear that Beyonce clearly studied and paid tribute to the greats of Dance while also having fun with it and not feeling too academic (something I fear Cowboy Carter didn't do as well). 2. I was cautiously optimistic, because I know Beyonce is so entrenched in southern culture, which includes probably hearing all the country tunes. Y'all gonna hate my ass for this opinion, but I still honestly don't view it totally in the Country Genre which I guess is the point, but def feels more in the Americana/Blues Rock which also heavily stole from Black culture (like she aint having a Rhinestone cowboy moment here). I guess that's the point but like even Daddy's Lessons feels more country than anything here 3. Just for Fun is really underrated, followed by Amen. 4. It Drags a little in the middle, where it becomes too cute for its own sake, but as a full fledge song Riverdance is a skip for me I fear",
    "Insanely amazing album.",
    "1. I think opening with Renaissance was the right thing to do given the timing with the rise of countrys popularity. On the one hand people couldve said Beyonce was once again ahead of the trends, but on the other hand people may have not taken it as seriously if they werent as willing to give country a chance. 2. After Daddy Lessons I knew Beyonce doing country would hit like crack, so I was totally looking forward to it! And I was right! It hit me like crack in the 80s! 3. A song I very rarely see people talking about is Alligator Tears. I love how swampy and raw it sounds, and Beyoncs vocal styling sounds unlike anything shes done before. I also think Protector is probably the best lyrics in a Beyonc song Ive ever heard. 4. If by reformat you mean keep every song and just move them, I actually think this is one of the best sequenced albums Ive ever listened to. The only thing I would say is maybe move 16 Carriages and Protector further away from the beginning of the album, but still keep them together. Even then, I think their placements are pretty good. 5. I may be from the south but Ive actually never liked grits lol.",
    "I feel like Daddy Lessons from Lemonade is better than anything on Cowboy Carter",
    ">Had Cowboy Carter released first, as originally intended, what do you think the reception wouldve been like, what would it have sounded like and how would it stand up once renaissance dropped. Honestly I think the reception would have pretty much the same. I have a feeling Daddy Lessons (and its CMA performance) was meant to lead us into Cowboy Carter and the last section of Cowboy Carter was meant to sonically lead us into Renaissance, which would have been cool, but otherwise it doesn't matter. It's interesting to think which of those albums would have won AOTY if Cowboy Carter had competed against Harry's House, but I think the two main things that got Beyonce the win this time around were the changes they made into the voting body and the political landscape after Trump's win. >If you went into this era apprehensive about the country angle, did the album change your mind? What's your opinion of it now vs when the album first came out I love country music and I would say I was more hyped about Beyonce going country before hearing the actual album lol. I love what we got but Daddy Lessons still reigns superior in my mind. >In your opinion what is the most underrated song on the album Alligator Tears >If you had to reformat the track list of the album, what would it look like and why I'm glad you asked because I have put a lot of thought into this lol. Basically I would move Bodyguard down to help with the slump and I removed the Ya Ya section because I don't like that song. 1. American Requiem 2. Blackbird 3. 16 Carriages 4. Protector 5. My Rose 6. Smoke Hour w Willie Nelson 7. Texas Hold Em 8. Dolly P 9. Jolene Redux 10. Daughter 11. The Linda Martell Show I 12. Spaghetti 13. Alligator Tears 14. Smoke Hour II w Willie Nelson 15. Just for Fun 16. Bodyguard 17. II Most Wanted 18. Levi's Jeans 19. Flamenco 20. The Linda Martell Show II 21. Sweet Honey Buckin 22. Riverdance 23. II Hands II Heaven 24. Dolly P II 25. Tyrant 26. Amen",
    "Yes on JUST FOR FUN for me (thought SPAGHETTII was #1 on my Amazon year-end).",
    "There were two correct answers to that question and this was one of them you are so right, If flamenco has no fans I am dead",
    "Yes! I think the thesis of the album comes from American Requiem when she says \"said I wasn't country enough, said I wouldn't saddle up, but if that ain't country, tell me what is?\" like making a country album because people said you aren't country is a super country thing to do lol. the traditional outlaw vibes have kind of been forgotten in the genre",
    "Thank you so much for your kind words!!! This write-up went through many lives and iterations (including me almost rewriting the entire thing from scratch at 2am last night) so Im happy you enjoyed it!! Same for me, the album truly captured me like nothing else has. I just kept hitting play again over and over until i knew it like the back of my hand. > You did my beloved \"JUST FOR FUN\" wrong, just glossing over it that way!  I know I know, I fully got stuck on what to say for alligator tears and just for fun for a *while* those were the two hardest songs to write about, especially just for fun because that was a bottom two song for me for a while, until a friend pointed out how underrated it was while we were going over rankings and then a few weeks later something just switched and I suddenly got it in a way I don't know how to translate the emotion into words!! It just suddenly became apart of me and it needs more love. Savory Style Grits for the win, you get it !!!",
    "Beyonc said in her RENAISSANCE film that she has nothing left to prove and her approach to social media and discourse is representative of that",
    ">I wonder how Beyonc feels... she probably felt so happy after being snubbed for so long in the main categories and now it's ruined as her social media has been flooded with hate I don't think Beyonc cares about what some *children* on the internet are saying (mostly white but I digress). She has the respect of the industry, and anyone mad over her winning a long overdue award on black history month was never gonna respect her in the first place. They gon make another one of her songs viral again when all is said and done. Monday I'm overrated, Tuesday on my dick",
    "One last note that I couldn't find a place in this answer to talk about - I noticed an interesting commonality between this and RENAISSANCE: both albums feel indebted to some of the pioneers of their respective genres. Here it was Willie, Linda and Dolly among others; in RENAISSANCE, I'm thinking of the nods to Donna Summer and Grace Jones, the sampling of Princess Loko on the opener, etc. I'm excited to see if Act III continues this trend (Beyonce metal album sampling Slayer and featuring Slipknot incoming 2026)",
    "Oh my god, I'm so happy you referenced that guy because I saw that article on my feed last night as the author retweeted it now to be like 'I'm right' but I forgot to save it because I wanted to touch on that!! Because in a 2015 lenses, i get where he was coming from however this was very much not a 'now thats what i call music, beyonce played a banjo for 10 minutes straight and we decided you know what, lets give her an award for it' this album is so dynamic and interesting and i'd argue the flaws that dont make it hit the mark even add to that since we know that beyonce always strives to do everything at her best!! I agree its far from boring even if it may not have been what you wanted as a listener",
    "I disagree, it's a great track but if Beyonc were to rework it now, I can see her adding more interesting production and harmonies to fill it out, it fills a bit empty compared to some tracks on CC like DAUGHTER or ALIIGATOR TEARS",
    "Yes, a 1000 times yes.",
    "Remove YA YA?! Holy shit that is sacrilegious ",
    "omggg i think yaya is the best on the album lol that is a hot take you've got there",
    "Completely agree with you about the voting body. When they has announced that at the Grammys and seeing how most people were happy with the awards given out.. it definitely seemed apparent that a change had been made. Makes you wonder what the demographic had been like throughout the last 10-15 years. I think the awards received would have looked very different.",
    "We both are!!! Amazing write up btw, thank you!!",
    "YASSSSS. Glad you have come around on \"JUST FOR FUN.\" I turned my sister on to the album in August, and JUST FOR FUN wound up her number one song on her Spotify Wrapped! I haven't listened to Willie Jones as much as I have listened to Shaboozey, but his stuff is good, too. Anyone, you nailed it. Roses, roses, brava, brava. <3",
    "To this, Id like to add that the Billie conversation is only among Gen Z. Demographics older than 30 dont really connect with Billie Eilish, and even though I enjoyed HMHAS I never saw it as a Grammy AOTY. It didnt have a widespread cultural impact the way Cowboy Carter, Short N Sweet, Brat or Midwest Princess all did.",
    "Yeah like this was SUCH an interesting project in what its trying to convey about social issues. Also very deeply rooted in history. I couldnt believe that tweet!!!",
    "I have never felt safe to admit this but honestly I think now listening to Lemonade which is widely viewed as her magnum opus I can't help but think how she would elevate it tremendously if she were to remake it now. Not to take away from its brilliance but the way she makes music is just much better now, even the gift which is just a soundtrack album sounds almost richer and fuller than lemonade (no shade to lemons tho she's still that gworl)",
    "HMHAS was great, don't get me wrong, but the actual cultural impact of the album was down to 1 song -- 'Birds of a Feather.' All of the other albums were more holistic with at least 2-3 'hits' or 'moments' from them that were widespread and talked about (and brat had the best Billie moment of the year in the remix of guess). I'd rank HMHAS very highly (imho) but I totally see how and why it didn't connect with more people, especially amongst those who are more likely to automatically check out a Beyonce album versus a Billie Eilish album (aka, most folks 30+ who may only be tangentially plugged into music).",
    "Agreed, I think she would actually add a lot from the visual album to it now, imagine interludes with the poetry. Her harmonies have been much more detailed and impressive on RENAISSANCE and COWBOY CARTER too, she would be going OFF if she made Lemonade nowadays I adore Lemonade but I think she has gotten better and better with each album since 4.",
    "I think Lemonade the album combined with its visual still stand as her best combined audio/visual project to date, but she's made better music and better videos since then - just never at the same time"
