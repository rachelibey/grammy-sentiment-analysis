    "Yeah this dress has a very important role in fashion history....but tbh any post of her, here, is going to be met with....almost blind and venomous hate. ",
    "Ill always see it this way.",
    "A Chilean celebrity just wore it to a festival red carpet because it is iconic. Honestly I don't think it causes as much awe to wear it now, for me at least. Yeah it's THE dress but the moment is gone.",
    "This is a perfect example of Motivating Operations.",
    "Before that dress, I was just merely a boy",
    "It was iconic. It was a defining fashion and pop culture moment. But Im not going to lie and wonder what else that dress may have seen that night now that we know what we know.",
    "Who was that quote actually said about?",
    "I'm telling my kids this is Elphaba and Galinda",
    "if anything i thought her using her DJ to fill in the lines she was out of breath for was such a smart move, it made the whole performance more cohesive and also more obvious that it was live? like, they were both on stage with mics lol",
    "Anyone whos seen her Tiny Desk concert would never think that for a second. Shes talented as *hell* man. There are hoards of untalented pop stars riding mommy and daddys money train who can barely call themselves artists, but these dorks are all WeLL aCkShuALLy LoOk aT hEr MoUtH ![gif](giphy|kZD8cN1MycfKw)",
    "I love Doechii so much",
    "Its so obvious shes singling live like what  I love her",
    "People are just making excuses to hate now because anyone with eyes could see it was live?",
    "Doing that in good health already seems like a challenge but doing it sick??? Holy. I cant wait to see whats next for her.",
    "To watch that performance and have any kind of critiques is wild It was amazing",
    "LOL people are so dumb. She literally has the DJ shes talking about in the act and they go back and forth. I mean tbh no matter what some people will always think someones lip synching.",
    "She ate this performance, and hoes are mad. Everyone intelligent knew she wasnt lip syncing. LMFAOO",
    "Theyre just hating because the DJ, Miss Milan, is present and CLEAR in the performance for Denial on the moving floor and theyre CLEARLY going back and forth. Theyre just mad whoever they wanted didnt win. I meansomeone said Beyonc is lazy because theyre a crazy Billie Stan, mad Billie didnt win AOTY. You can say many things about Beyonclazy?! Thats just a lie and hater nonsense. I hate how being a psycho stan is normalized and you can just say whatever you want",
    "She is a gorgeous specimen of a human in every way.",
    "it wasnt hard to realize that the performance was live",
    "Doechii being all...I got bronchitis... ![gif](giphy|Her8HwkH9Fa3S)",
    "Ugh. I just love her so much. Go OFF Doechii",
    "I remember watching her perform Wat U Sed with Isaiah Rashad at the 2021 BET awards and being absolutely blown away by how perfect and clean her vocals were (WHILE doing choreo of course). Just incredible breath control. And shes only gotten better! People really are stupid. If you know nothing about live vocal performances you should just shut up and enjoy the artistry lol",
    "I love her shes so hot, and I mean that in personality first and foremost, just so happens shes also physically stunning",
    "Im glad she stands up for herself on this. Many times artists let these comments slide. I would be pissed too if someone said I didnt do my performance live especially if I was sick!",
    "I don't blame her for being aggravated, but I hope she doesn't burn herself out on social media a la Chappell. I don't think it's coincidence that the celebs who seem well-adjusted are the ones who stay offline.",
    "I need people to learn the difference between a backing track and lipsyncing",
    "Why are artists always sick for important taped performances?",
    "You could hear her pant throughout the song and there were different voice inflections throughout. A lip synced performance would be too clean and missing the rawness. Lots of people use vocal fills or tracks to make the songs sound fuller. Its clear people dont understand how it works. Her performance was electric.",
    "It's so easy for people to sit on their couches and pick apart a performance! These trolls have zero understanding how much work and preparation goes into something like this. I am glad Doechii responded even though she shouldn't have to prove herself whatsoever. She is an unbelievable performer and artist.",
    "I hate that she even felt the need to respond to such obvious nonsense.",
    "it was painfully obvious to me it was live, the girl needs to breathe!!!!",
    "People said the same thing about Benson Boone's performance which was also obviously live ",
    "![gif](giphy|2oUfvvUgQHnLsQWFMW) MY GIRLLL",
    "So stupid. The public finds someone famous and good and just says \"let's fuck with her\"",
    "Im in love with her ",
    "People be complaining about anything these days. Not worth responding to everything",
    "Shes talented for sure but going to an event to spread the flu is definitely a choice",
    "i love her with all my heart lol",
    "I refuse to let people come for my girl like that. No, she actually can sing live. Sorry folk for this who dont know what talent is.",
    "Do people really not know that a lot of artists do that",
    "ridiculous criticism in the first place esp when a lot of SINGERS, not even rappers, use backing tracks to help with vocals. it was so clear with her breathing and placement she was rapping live. also her skin is god damn flawless.",
    "Responding to everyone on social media is what sends these stars into an emotional tailspin. Why is it so difficult to ignore?",
    "Doechii!!! Don't question this badass.",
    "Yeah tell them, she killed her performance",
    "I know it's not the point but she's so stunning. Like ugh imagine being that smart, funny, articulate and just beautiful",
    "I expect a fire song out of this, Doechii.",
    "Lmao I love her. It's so obvious she was singing live because you could even hear her breathing at times. She did amazing and some people really need to being overly negative about promising performers.",
    "As someone with chronic bronchitis, I struggle with even getting a sentence out while talking on the phone or in person when Im sick, let alone performing and dancing on the Grammys! My respect for her just went up 100 fold with this! WOW! (And Ive already become a fan from her performance at the Grammys and being an out queer woman).",
    "Also, how is she not blue checked on TikTok yet?! wtf?!",
    "People are truly dumb I agree Its actually so fucking tiring seeing people who dont know shit act like they know how live performances work",
    "Literally HOW with bronchitis! I have it now and theres a coughing fit every ten mins. I need to know her magic! Shes amazing.",
    "Seriously, do people not understand live performances? Even when it's not someone else you can't see on stage signing the live parts, you should be able to tell when they're singing and when it's just recorded audio. It's not like they're trying to fool the audience.",
    "They can never make me hate Doechii.",
    "I love her ",
    "I hope shes okay, that looks like a hospital room setting",
    "It was SO obviously live!!! This isnt speaking to the use of performance tracks, this is about her, and that was SO live. Her DJ filled in a very smart way, and shes talking over her own track! She isnt trying to hide those dubs. Shes performing.",
    "Seriously if you didnt notice her DJ (Milan, a talent in her own right), that was a you problem lol, she was pretty prominently featured in the performance right up in the front next to Doechii",
    "That's what I thought too. Also I don't want to hear sick voice on stage. It's enough she was even there.",
    "Good point! That Tiny Desk concert was an amazing showcase of her artistry and how seamlessly her band and dj support each song.",
    "Pop stars mind you while Doechii is up there rapping her face off and doing serious choreography and acrobatics. That level of breath control is hard to fathom.",
    "the simping is crazy",
    "So excited for someone new and so mother fucking talented",
    "People give too much credit to online comments. Like its probably a twelve year old boy.",
    "Good lord if anybody out there considers Beyonce lazy, I dread to think what theyd consider me lmao. Wild how ppls music taste literally distorts reality ",
    "Doechii has been rising up in the scene for a bit longer. Her song Yucky Blucky Fruitcake was a pandemic hit and she got her first platinum song 2 years ago. I think her recent album is a reflection on the burn out stage",
    "Long days, hard work, little sleep, high stress levels and constantly going around and being in the vicinity of a lot of other people who may carry whatever kind of bugs. Not sure but a performance like that takes a ton of prep, Im sure the whole proces is exhausting and not that great for your health.",
    "Right?? I wish working while sick wasnt normal. The flu is really bad this year",
    "She's so incredible people literally can't believe it. I love her so much--she's so unique and so cool, she's resetting the bounds of what's possible. Her blackness and her intentional performance of it is so beautiful. Same goes for her femininity and her sheer brilliance. Jfc what a badass. Low key crush.",
    "I was in awe when I saw it! Doechii gives me chills. Ive seen her tiny desk so many times now. So good.",
    "and she did it all with bronchitis!!!! I am all aboard the Doechii train, shes a phenomenal talent and the girls who get it, get it",
    "That you Azalea Banks?",
    "Im not even really a fan of Beyonc and I would fight someone if they said she was lazy. lol",
    "Not to mention being in enclosed spaces with lots of crew/ staff, the press run, etc. stress and exposure to people and germs you usually are t exposed to.",
    "I understand her working while sick in this case lol. Its the Grammys.",
    "I agree with everything you said 100%. And also high key crush over here lollll",
    "I understand but I dont think its responsible",
    "You got downvoted for this, but I totally agree.",
    "Yeah Im already well aware most people dont care. I thought we learned in 2020 but I guess not",
    "Best performance of the night! Incredible!",
    "Shes absolutely electric. i havent seen a rapper with choreo in awhile.",
    "Shes so fricking awesome",
    "Amazing performance. You can tell she's a theater kid",
    "mouth was hanging open the entire performanceshes the real deal!",
    "Im in love.",
    "Carrying around a giant wad of cash just for tipping must feel great.",
    "Notice she asks first - \"are you allowed to accept tips?\" That clearly shows she does this regular. Lots of places in the UK don't allow you to accept tips, when working retail/hospitality/service jobs.. she wants to show her appreciation, but ensures she doesn't get them in trouble too. Pretty classy.",
    "Do you think she has pre-rolled 20s and 50s in her bag for tipping opportunities?",
    "I know people might think this is performative, but good for her. Too many wealthy celebrities are known for not tipping or barely tipping at all (I understand theyre for the event and its not obligated but still).",
    "She's always done stuff like this tbh I remember years ago she ran into some girls at central park who were fans and they told her they were going to chipotles so she handed them cash too",
    "Guys its not performative anymore if its done consistently over decades. lol She literally tipped her crew a 100k. Like come on now.",
    "Taylor has been consistently praised as always respecting and paying the people around her extremely well. Since she was a teenager she has a track record of being generous and friendly to all staff. She knows thats not good enough for some people, as its still perceived as performative (*covert narcissism disguised as altruism*). But she continues to do it, consistently and also privately - where its not recorded. So many rich or famous people are stingy little ego fucks who dont tip or respect us peasants, and they just get called iconic rockstars or divas for asshole behavior. Taylor has polite manners to service workers and people still find a way to be BEC about it  Perfection is the enemy of good enough and all that.",
    "Not the people getting pressed in the comments  I have relatives who live in the united states, and these hefty tips from celebs cover anything from a week's groceries to your standard wifi/frugal electricity bill. Stop shitting on people getting the bag.",
    "Isnt she known for being incredibly generous with her money? And not publicising it? Like donating to go fund mes and food banks etc? I know its becoming a trend to hate on Taylor but I say good for her!",
    "Good for her! If I were a billionaire, id be doing stuff like this too.",
    "She tipped even her truck drivers thousands extra each. I would do the same if I'd be a billionaire",
    "For people saying this is \"PR\" or staged, i'd say look at the context: There is an extensive history of stories about her doing things like this over the years, and we don't see videos every time. She did it very quickly as she was walking by, so it makes sense there isn't always footage of it. This time someone was already filming as celebrities walked by them, and got it on camera. Not everything needs to be a conspiracy, sometimes people just do nice things.",
    "i am sure everyone is going to act normal about this",
    "Love her or hate her, but the way its been widely reported how well she treats her crew and staff while on tour, I genuinely think shes a decent person.",
    "I swear to god that Taylor could find a cure to every known cancer and people would still say its performative and that shes only doing it because its a disease that affects her personally. Is being gracious to workers just basic human decency? Absolutely. But Im sure the money and kindness was appreciated regardless and its not performative because someone who is constantly being filmed was caught being nice on camera. My lord.",
    "I am not a fan of hers for a million reasons, but I fuck with this heavily. I'm poor and I find a lot of joy in charity and I always wondered why you never saw the ultra rich doing more things like this. If I was rich, it would make me so happy to be slipping $100s to people everywhere. I'd be like a Grandma giving you a hidden five dollar bill in front of your mom.",
    "I must say, shes good like that. Generous",
    "She does a lot and doesnt have to! She doesnt get enough credit for her kind heart. She could keep all of that money and still have all the fans!",
    "I recently worked an event at a club. Like a social club. And I cannot tell you how many people came up to me and said thank you for keeping us safe. Thank you for being on the lookout. Really appreciate you. And even that was really nice because you think youre just a fly on the wall, keeping the floors clean or keeping weirdos out of the VIP. But some degree it is appreciated and thats kind of nice.",
    "im honestly so over the taylor-hate-train. obv her artistry isnt for everyone, but damn she seems to be a genuinely nice person. she doesnt give off fake vibes either. taylor is consistent afaik.",
    "Women billionairs like taylor or MacKenzie Scott do this and men (and some pick me women brainwashed by patriarchy) buy islands full of children, white houses and nazis. Yall will never be able to convince me that a matriarchy wouldnt be the superior social system",
    "As a long time fan what keeps her as my number one popstar is not just the great music and hard work but the fact that she has time and again proven to be a nice human. Sure, everyone in the limelight can falter on certain fronts but there are some really horrible famous people and I am glad she isn't one of them.",
    "Kudos to her - its nothing to her but could mean a lot to hospitality workers",
    "I may not like her music, but if I had her money I wish I could do the same",
    "Aww the workers sound so grateful. This made me happy",
    "There's no winning with Taylor Swift haters. She's a really cool and nice person. The haters can fuck off.",
    "Ive been a fan of her since the early days. She used to randomly give fans on Tumblr money whenever they mentioned they were struggling. Shes been incredibly generous since day one, well before anyone was looking at her to call it performative.",
    "Fun fact. Ive never seen Trump tip anyone. Also one never seen him pay his bills.",
    "I honestly dont understand people who are angry about this. Even IF it is performative, shes still giving service workers hefty tips. Isnt that better than not tipping?",
    "Jlo would never ",
    "Reminds me of Amandaland lol, \"anyone here like 20 notes?\" Nice gesture though, I bet the haters hate it",
    "Some billionaire artist even refuse to pay their own workers, so it's nice to see a celebrity actually do visible real good with their money that skips the middle man of \"charities\" and just give back to the people you know aren't getting paid shit.",
    "Not a fan of her music but shes a good person, very kind and generous!!",
    "Taylors just a kind person, she really does not deserve the hate.",
    "Class act. TYSM and a look in the eyes",
    "Not to mention for the fires she posted the organizations she donated to - 11 of them I believe I counted - and did not mention how much she donated. Just that those were the ones she chose and you could donate to them too if you felt like it and could. I love that.",
    "I think this is genuine, and I adore her for it.",
    "More people who are able to do that should.",
    "Here come all the TSwift complainers in 3..2..1",
    "Listen say what you will about Taylor Swift, but it says a lot of people even someone who is famous as her, if they are able to go the extra mile to tip so good for her.",
    "It would make my day to get a tip from her this is very sweet!",
    "I mean she did give major bonuses to the workers from her Eras tour so im not surprised. Perhaps its performative but at least they got tipped for their hard work at the event",
    "You know what, I didnt really think anything of Taylor Swift either way a year or so back. I just had her down as this generations answer to Kylie Minogue and Britney Spears. Having seen/learned a bit more, I have to say that I think she is a fantastic person and an absolutely brilliant role model not just for young girls, but for people as a whole. She seems grounded, happy, does the right thing and just seems like a really good person.",
    "I know a lot of people will say she is just doing this for the camera but she is also generous to her staff and others in private. I think taking care of the people who take care of you is about the least a billionaire can do and too few of them do it.",
    "I swear, if someone made me rich, I would do that too.",
    "why do people dislike this woman",
    "I mean say what you want about her but shes always been know for being generous. Even at the start of her career. I dont think its performative, she gave huge bonuses to the people who worked on her tour and she donates to like almost every cause. And not small donation either. Its like the one thing about her that people should be allowed to criticize because she should be the example to follow not the exception to the rule. I had a friend work for J Lo a couple of years ago for some PR stuff and he said the vibe coming from her was that she thinks since she came from nothing and worked hard to get to this level and nobody handed her anything that people should work hard if they want something instead of asking people for help:money.",
    "Her head security guard moves with such grace. Hes fascinating to watch as he shadows her.",
    "ome thing I appreciate a lot about taylor is that she really values the industry she's in, but like, collectively. it's clearly not just the artists, but stage folks, tour truck drivers, security staff at venues, record store employees ,etc. we know she values her team a lot (many have been with her for years), dancers and musicians, but it's very important to value less visible parts of the entertainment industry. and i don't care either way if she's photographed doing it or not, but maybe this makes another rich celeb go like \"hm i guess i should tip the staff at the venue\" because it had never crossed their mind. then the staff receives more tips and that's what actually matters",
    "Jesus, people in these commments are so ridiculous with your \"I don't like her but...\" \"her music sucks, but...\" \"I'm def not a Swiftie but...\" You dont have to preface your compliment with a disclaimer so that \\*\\*god forbid\\*\\* no one accidentally thinks you might be a fan! You can just say something nice about someone. You won't die.",
    "I don't know why people hate her so much. She seems really generous and even in this video, everyone else walked by these hardworking people like they were invisible but she stopped and talked to them and showed some appreciation for them. I'm sure Taylor has her flaws, like every other human being, but she seems pretty generous and actually cares about the world around her. She went to that children's hospital around Christmas then sent them all gifts, she donates to food banks and other great causes. As wealthy celebrities go, I think she's alright.",
    "People need to understand that not everything is black and white. You can dislike her for some things and respect or appreciate other things she does. You can dislike part of her fandom and dance to her music.",
    "As someone who doesn't live somewhere with tipping culture other than at table service restaurants - how do you approach/address people to tip them in these sorts of situations, like what do you say?",
    "If I had that much money I would love to do the same. Its a shame more dont do this regularly. The easiest way to make someones day and its nothing to them.",
    "I will always respect her for this",
    "I worked in the service industry in NYC for over 15 years. Celebrities who are generous and kind have good reputations and the ones who are assholes are widely known as such. Swift has an excellent reputation. Shes the real deal",
    "I dont love her but she always seems to be tipping people, whether in front of a camera or not. Cant hate on that at all.",
    "Look, I despise her music, its not for me whatsoever. But almost everything Ive heard about her doing, the way she carrys herself in interviews or fan interactions, she seems to be one of the extremely rare 0.0000001% of ultra wealthy human beings that corruption and greed hasnt taken ahold of yet and thats good enough for me shes one of, if not the only billionaire on the planet Id gladly shake hands with and thank them for what they do.",
    "Not a \"swiftie\" but she's earned my respect, action speaks louder than words.",
    "People are calling it performative, but money is money. It's still a generous gesture. I still prefer performative kindness over the opposite. If I find myself in a group of people who booh her more than they booh a greedy, stingy, toxic, vicious tyrant .. then I know I am in a group with stupid priorities. Yes, I know that the audience at the sportsgame booed her because they're unhappy with which sports team she supports. Like I said; stupid priorities.",
    "I like her dress ",
    "One of the few who actually tips and pays her ppl!",
    "And the haters will find an issue with it somehow. She did it for attention. It was staged. She didnt give enough. She was smug when she gave them the money. She treated them like a charity case. Am I missing any?",
    "Her entire public life is being sucked through a lens almost all the time. She doesn't choose whether it's performative or not.",
    "Money means nothing to her, but, she knows it means everything to everyone else. She is a wonderful human being",
    "She does this all the time. Usually not filmed. She is a sweetheart.",
    "She a real one. Meanwhile, Kanye is jerking off to concentration camp footage in the back alley after he got kicked out for low class and deplorable behavior lol",
    "Love her or hate her, she seems to be a genuinely kind person who wants to have a good time and enjoy her life.",
    "Ugh she's the worst! How dare she flaunt her money like that..... is what I would say if i was a mouth breather",
    "Shes annoying but what she did for her tour in bonuses, shes a legend.",
    "She does this everywhere all the time and so many other good things yet she gets bood and hated on. This country is in the upside down.",
    "Such a nice woman",
    "OMG I'm so glad they had a camera right there to catch all of this",
    "shes a good person idk why she gets so much hate. I mean her music is meh for me. But as a person shes seems cool.",
    "I love her and dont understand how anyone could dislike her. She genuinely seems like such a lovely person.",
    "I love Taylor!! Shes the best!!!",
    "I am convinced people hate her over her fan base more than who she is because as someone who does not like her music she still Seems like an absolute sweetheart compared to other celebrities.",
    "I'm not a fan of Taylor, but I'm a big fan of workers being paid. Good on her, I hope other artists tip at events like this!",
    "![gif](giphy|AgPt9udT567spxbSHf)",
    "Her mama raised a very compassionate human being.",
    "Our Queen continues to Queen. Love it.",
    "It was nice of her to also say We appreciate you so much. That goes a long way for someone to hear.",
    "I'm pretty indifferent to her, but I've consistently seen over the years that she is quite generous. So credit to her for that. She had the money in her hand too, so evidently she was always planning to hand it out.",
    "No but like.idk how she does it  Ive loved her since I was young, and my mom loves her bc shes one of the few celebs who became famous as a child and never went through an unhinged, for lack of a better term, phase. You see so so many celebs that end up addicted to drugs or severely depressed bc of the pressure, like literally 99% of humans wouldand Taylor is somehow a lil insane in that she hasnt gone through anything like that publicly, she has a solid reputation for being kind and charitable, is severely scrutinized for every move, hated by insecure men everywhere, booed at the Super Bowl, and she brushes it all off?????  To be clear, this isnt to deride anyone else bc I can PROMISE you id crash out week one of recurving a tenth as much scrutinyand thats even normal and human! Its just insane what shes had to go through and, yet, she hasnt seemed to have lost herself with it",
    "not even 1% of her wealth but my Mother is very generous and even on her own pension she tips people who help her with any chores and for good meals at restaurants... one day I asked her why she tips that much and she told me that she knows the value of hardwork, skill and hospitality. She went on assert that it is her money that she uses for tipping and it should be none of our business :)",
    "Regardless of what's said about her, or even some people booing her, she gets it done. And sets a great example. Even if it is performative, which I don't think it is, it's a nice thing. We need more of that.",
    "clearly it's better to be an asshole so that when you do something nice people aren't trying to find ways to knock you down",
    "I do not generally care for her but somewhere along the line she was taught to be kind and tip service workers, so she is aces in my book. You cannot teach this.",
    "Thats so sweet of her. Ive always heard shes super generous to her staff/crew so this honestly doesnt surprise me",
    "She can be performative while still doing something good. Intention does not lessen the impact. Shes always seemed to be a very generous woman",
    "I know a certain orange someone who doesn't even pay his bills.",
    "Her generosity is something I've always admired and greatly appreciated about her.",
    "Does Taylor have flaws and things she sold be criticised for? Yes. Was this a nice thing of her to do? Also yes.",
    "That's why billionaires have run campaigns to malign her image in right wingers minds",
    "I would think this was performative if this wasnt actually what she does on a consistent basis in front of and behind the camera.",
    "As I kid, I used to daydream about having a giant wad of cash and then walking down the street and giving it away to all the homeless people Id see on my way to school ",
    "![gif](giphy|987p6CfE8uzSg|downsized)",
    "I'd feel SO rich",
    "This is one of the primary reasons I want to be rich, to tip A LOT to people who deserve it",
    "I think that's a little unfair. Even at worst, she did a good thing here. I can't think of selfish reasons to do this. She's not responsible for the economic divide between people. And even benefitting from it, she still thinks it is important to recognize the people who do the work it takes to make her life possible. Famous and rich or not, she is still just some woman. And if I saw some woman do this, in any other scenario and if it was anyone else, I would think well of them. It must be nice having that money, but there are a lot worse ways I know she could be spending it than supporting working people. It's easy for rich people to donate large amounts to a charity and still be pieces of shit. I have yet to find someone who is a shitty person and also takes the time to thank and tip the person sweeping the floors after they leave.",
    "I'm not rich but palming a tip makes me feel that way!",
    "Some of these rich fucks don't even tip so good on her for that",
    "I dont understand how anyone can find fault in this. Taylor has many other things to bitch about, but her kindness and generosity is a constant great thing about her! ETA: sorry I didnt mean to reply to you specifically",
    "There's a lot of videos of her doing this. It's super heartwarming.",
    "Technically a lot of places in the US dont allow it either as far as retail and service jobs. However Ive never had a manager actually care, and Ive had multiple tell me to just take them. End of the day the bottom level managers who actually know it happens, barely make more than us, and understand the struggle. So from my experience theyve always turned a blind eye to it.",
    "And their are literal hate subs for this person..lol",
    "Ill forever remember this time my friends convinced me to go a state over to see a show at the last minute and the tickets were sold out when I got there (they had their tickets) once everyone was in the bouncer snuck me in without having to pay cause he felt bad. Dude was obviously not allowed to accept tips so I slipped him the money I brought for my ticket during a handshake like a movie drug deal while thanking him.",
    "She hands out $100 bills, a few people have gotten tips from her and shared it on tiktok.",
    "An ultimate way to flex. Well, she does 100s too going by this one viral photo of her from that Chiefs game:",
    "I would if i was a billionaire, imagine being able to make people's day so easily. I can't believe more rich people aren't like this",
    "If I was that rich, I'd have a professional bill-roller on staff. And I'd tip them too.",
    "She probably has $100s at the ready in the same way I have dollar bills at the ready in case someone needs money on the subway. ",
    "She absolutely does. 100s I bet though.",
    "I'm a non-American & I have a question related to this. In the UK our homeless people have complained about how difficult it is to get money from people these days. Barely anyone carries cash anymore, everything is paid via card or apps. Its that rare to need cash we get a surprise if we're told something is cash only & have to run to find a cash machine as it's not worth always having cash on us. Is it similar in the US? And have people in jobs like this clip where they rely on cash, found they are no longer receiving as much in tips due to lack of cash? I can see people in services jobs where card payments are already the norm may be doing OK as you can add a tip to your bill. And you can add a tip to an uberfood or justeat delivery. But what about people like in this clip, or the people in hotels who carry your bags, or bring your room service? Or is cash still very much a widely used thing in the US for this reason?",
    "Shes a famous billionaire lol. Aint no way she would tip that low. That would look bad. Most likely shes tipping 100.",
    "I have a pre-roll of $2 bills I get from the bank to hand out to people on the subways and streets. Started doing it at the holiday and really enjoy it. My friend once said I wonder if they think its fake money and that gave me pause but I still love it lol",
    "Definitely a benjamin",
    "One of her podcast appearances she said she requests stock of $100s to give out. I'm not even a fan of her and call her out on other hypocrises, but there's photos of her with $100s too, so I think at her level that's pretty believable, I give her that.",
    "Im gonna start keeping cash in my bag to tip people, that was a boss bitch move. Except Im poor so itll be ones and fives instead of hundreds but still.",
    "Even if its performative, I doubt those workers are complaining about it.",
    "The exact sort of performatism where everyone wins, tbh. Let billionaires be pressured into handing out cash to people earning 50c an hour",
    "Like after seeing so many billionaires giving bare minimum after the fires, i support any kind of act of giving to people",
    "She's always been known for giving tips + bonuses to everyone who works for her though. It's not hard to just accept she's a caring person. People always have to create an ulterior motive/narrative with Taylor for some reason lol, maybe she's just.... nice?",
    "Im not fan of Taylor but its really no winning tbh. She does it in front of cameras or announces it and its shes so performative, they never do it secretly but then if she doesnt do it in front of cameras its Id like Taylor to do some charity for once. Shes still a billionaire but idk people would complain when these workers still got paid by her.",
    "She always have been like this. She paid her band a better salary than everyone else",
    "The only ones who are performative, are the ones who complain online about it.",
    "Oh anyone who says its performative is bitching just to bitch. Shes a billionaire and shes just a singer, shes not giving out bribes or handouts to wealthy corporations. If she wants to give back some of her wealth in the form of some $100 bills to working class people, I say let her. It costs her nothing but may be a huge deal to the recipient. As long as its real money I say perform away!",
    "she can perform a few hundred into my bank account idc",
    "Agreed good for the workers they deserve it",
    "Yeah she cant win either way, may as well be hated for doing the decent thing rather than not doing anything at all.",
    "I do stage rigging as a job and deconstructed the stage she performed at in Cardiff, Wales last year. I wasnt even main crew but our catering was all paid for out of her pocket, and she donated 50k to charities that help fight poverty in that city, and every other city she performed at in the UK. Say what you want about the private jets she uses, legitimate criticism, but she puts her money where her mouth is at least, and looks after people. Shes got the money to do so and she does. Still dont like her music, but she seems to be a better person than the internet makes her out to be",
    "People who may not necessarily get a lot of tips/earn a lot normally are getting free money. Regardless of what you think about Taylor, thats cool! Redistribute more wealth!!",
    "Taylor has always done this. Its not performative if you are always doing it and always making it a part of your brand. Like FFS someone cant be an ethical CEO? What do people want? United dude instead cheating on his wife and killing people for profit? Whatever she gave them prob covered a day of food, a bill, gas for a week, and people have the nerve to call it performative when shes been doing this for 15 years?",
    "its so counterproductive to argue about when people are doing the right thing (like giving money they dont have to)",
    "I think anyone who thinks its performative should just look at her long record of giving back. $100,000 to every truck driver, donations, tipping people. Not all celebrities were raised like assholes. EDIT: and if you still think all that is performative, I just think that means youve never had a boss or guest have respect t for you enough to give you a bonus/tip.",
    "She gave a portion of her was yours earnings to the truck drivers that drove her equipment and busses and things as a bonus. Some hit over $100k in bonuses. IDC what you think about her politics or her music. Shes a fucking sweetheart.",
    "Exactly! So what if it benefits her plus them and hurts no one!",
    "It's a win-win. Charity is a win-win. She gets to look like the good guy, they get a little extra to do what they want. Nobody is hurt. Love it.",
    "Its honestly probably pretty hard for it not to be performative when literally everything you do is photographed or recorded - at that point I just start giving benefit of the doubt for all seemingly random acts of kindness.",
    "And you know what even if it's performative as long as she's doing something good and not holding it over people's heads it's all good. People are so worried about reasons not to be good instead of just doing good stuff and dealing with the consequences that don't matter at all",
    "Nah, the way she has money ready to go, asks them if they can accept tips and then discreetly hand them some money show this is part of her routine. Hate her or not, this is some classy shit to do.",
    "I live in Vegas and work in casinos. The most popular celebrity who didnt tip, name who comes up? Michael Jordan. Billionaire.",
    "I accept 100% of performative tips, please and thank you lol",
    "Damned if you do, damned if you dont. Not a fan of Taylors music, but we are often waaay too critical of this woman lol",
    "It should be encouraged. \"Oh its performative\" okay well... it's better than the performances of being a good person most celebrities do. Let's get rich people competing to be most charitable again, instead of building superyachts and destroying democracy",
    "She gave them chipotle money? Bro I swear to god if someone did that for me I would be so goddamn jolly about it",
    "I like the story where she gave someone her purse lmao. I forget if it was a fan or maybe a journalist but someone complimented her purse and she just emptied it and let them have it. And on her birthday at the childrens hospital when people dragged her for wearing an expensive outfit and she sent a little girl the same outfit a few days later because the little girl complimented it. Or the 10M she donated for victims of the LA fires. I will never understand the hate for this woman. She doesnt have to do any of the things she does and is so overly criticized and ripped apart for no reason.",
    "it was the fan's birthday! she gave the girl $90 and asked if it was enough to cover it",
    "Omg the $90 for chipotle  i think about that often.",
    "My friend went on tour with paramore when they opened for TS recently. Not even with Taylors team, and almost every other night she was getting goody bags and favors from Taylor, coming home (edit: to the hotel) to country-specific snacks and noveltieseven some commemorative jewelry too. Shes always shown gratitude",
    "I remember that. I think it was one of the girls birthday too",
    "Looks like she was in a hurry too. But still stopped",
    "She gave her tour crew atleast 55 million dollars in bonuses and donated to every stops food banks.",
    "Idc if its even performative, its nice and generous. That extra tip makes a huge difference to someone. She feels good, they feel good. Everyone is happy.",
    "I'm not exactly a fan of her music, but the overwhelming hate she gets just seems odd to me. She seems like a genuinely nice person.",
    "More than 100K. She gave them 200M in bonuses all together",
    "Its very telling that several of her band and her glam team have been with her since those early days.",
    "Even if it's performative it's still real money for real people, so why should we complain about it. They're still going to be happy no matter the reasons Taylor had for doing it. I don't really like her but there's nothing to complain about with her tipping people a lot.",
    "What I struggle with is peoples binary perception of celebrities as entirely good vs entirely evil. Taylor, like like the vast majority of people, does good things and bad things. She is nuanced. Its fine to frown upon her private jet usage while simultaneously appreciating her being generous to staff.",
    "How would she go about NOT tipping performatively, though? (Not actually asking you, personally, just the world at large.) Everywhere she goes, there are cameras. Is she supposed to apply elaborate disguises and double back into buildings like a secret agent losing an enemy tail? \"Sorry guys, I see paps, so no tips today!\" SMH",
    "My partner told me last night that Kristin Bell does a lot of charitable stuff that nobody knows about because she doesn't talk about it or take clips of it. I guess it was on Dax's podcast or something?",
    "I love her so much  I always remember reading some article long ago where a fan comes up to her during the interview and says its her birthday and Taylor gives her money and says birthday dinners on her or something lol This has always made me feel like damn I want to casually run into Taylor and get my palm greased",
    "I literally dont give a rats ass if its performative bc she helps people why does it even matter?",
    "She gave almost $200 million in bonuses to everyone on her Eras tour. I know for one person it was $100k.",
    "They could never make me hate Taylor. Occasionally a hateful comment makes me post a list of many of her amazing deeds she never publicized and I get downvoted into oblivion because what about the private jet!!! But shes a GOOD person. The world is better because shes in it. Edit: Annnnd now theres so much hatred below this comment, grasping at straws and misinformation. Ill never understand why some people dont pour their hearts and energy into the things they love instead of the things they hate. This world would be a much better place if they did.",
    "My brother in law did security for her years back on multiple occasions. He said she was always very polite and considerate towards him and the rest of his detail.",
    "Yet people all over love to lump her in with every other billionaire. It always feels like misogyny. She seems nice and is actually talented, but people will rip her (and honestly most women) apart for every action or inaction.",
    "Classy and kind.",
    "I mean there's definitely other valid reasons to criticize her but this is one of the reasons why I'll always have some respect for her. She values people's work and what they do behind the scenes and even the little things they do that people don't even realize. I'm glad her employees and the people around her are appreciated",
    "I dont understand the hate she gets. Shes existing, creating art and treating the people around her generously. She speaks out on issues that matter to her both as press releases and through her music. What more do people want?",
    "I'll support this type of narcissism any day. Lol",
    "I can't help but think it's part of why she's so successful. Being a good person to work with/for is key to success in many careers.",
    "Yeah I cant be mad at this. She wasnt filming herself, she has the ability to do so, and it made the workers happy especially when theyre forgotten about. I call her capitalist Barbie every time I see her and Id still take the money and say thank you lol Im broke.",
    "Is that the new American dream?",
    "She donated to the LA fires, and while she didnt publicize how much, its rumored she gave $10 million. During Covid she gave away smaller sums of money directly to fans (like $13,000 because she loves the number 13). I believe she also paid for health insurance for the employees of a record store in Nashville during Covid. She gave her Eras tour truck drivers a $100,000 bonus each. Those are just the things we know about. Shes incredibly generous and its very heartwarming!",
    "I heard that she gave extremely generous donations to food banks in each stop on the eras tour.",
    "Billboard ran a story a few weeks ago of her donation history. I think its easy to forget how often shes donated or given away money (I forgot about her giving money to Keshas legal defense).",
    "What has she done to justify the hate she gets? Just being successful?",
    "Every city she visited on her tour she donated millions to local food banks and homeless shelters. And she gave all the truck drivers for her tour something like a $100k bonus. Shes incredibly generous.",
    "People don't understand how massive this is! Truck drivers don't get bonus, like EVER. And she was handing them out 100k to EACH driver, for just 6 month touring! Several people are walking out of that Eras Tour as millionaires or half a millionaires, bet!",
    "I believe it was $100k each bonus. Life changing money.",
    "Plus this is her after party dress, so shes definitely a few drinks deep by this point and probably not focused on scheming and plotting.",
    "Exactly. I understand she does this all the time so how performative can it be if its a regular thing? Let her performative her ass all day long for these hard working folks",
    "also lets say even if it was for PR, i kinda dont care if taylor swift gets good PR for doing good things",
    "They can never be normal about a single Taylor swift related thing",
    "True. And she knows this 100%. So its great she gives anyway, knowing she would get flack either way, at least here some deserving people get a little extra money.",
    "I like that she doesn't give a shit and does it anyway.",
    ">Doesn't give at all: cheap-ass billionaire Fair lol",
    ">I swear to god that Taylor could find a cure to every known cancer and people would still say its performative and that shes only doing it because its a disease that affects her personally. How selfish. She's leaving all those oncologists out of work.",
    "Bruh it isnt just this, she has donated a ton of money to random fans throughout the years and never said anything about it and people still think she is a demon and only doing that shit for good publicity even tho she never advertised it. Its never enough!!!",
    "Same. Maybe I don't like certain things she does, but I've admired her charity work and heard she's a good tipper.",
    "Anytime I end up at a fancy event I always thank everyone working bc low-key I feel like I dont belong there lmao and I identify more with the staff than anyone else because I grew up super poor. So while everyone is talking about skiing and where they summered and shit Im like uhhh yeah I grew up in a trailer park and when I visited the homeland I lived in a grass hut??? lol",
    "Ive never seen a clip of her being rude or stand-offish with anyone she deals with. It doesnt seem to have gone to her head.",
    "This. Shes also really generous especially with young fans. Theres a great clip of her getting papped walking into dinner or something, and this young voice says her name. She immediately stops and goes over to give the kid a hug and chat.",
    "Me too. She shows genuine respect to others, whether they are service people, other artists, her team or her fans. There are so many examples of this and just one that directly affected me and everyone that went to Eras - she started at the specified time, every night, unless there was a *force majeure* totally out of her control. This shows respect for other peoples time and energy. That along with all the charities she has supported (mostly silently), her behaviour to her team and all of these random acts of kindness, make me proud to call myself a fan.",
    "Haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate",
    "If Jlo saw, shed rush over to snatch those tips away.",
    "I friggin loved Amandaland .",
    "She gave those tips out in the same way my gran used to slip me a fiver.",
    "The way he turned on a dime. Hes use to Taylor doubling back ",
    "His name is Drew too which makes Drew walks by me in Tear Drops on my Guitar a much funnier lyric.",
    "In this video she says \"are you guys allowed to take tips\" as she approaches which i think is the appropriate way",
    "but also employers paying living wages",
    "I used to work in a restaurant that would let me take leftover food after my shift to hand out to homeless people. The looks on their faces when I dropped off a bag of warm food was sometimes better than the paycheck. Edit: Not leftover like from someones half eaten plate. Just stuff from the kitchen that would have been thrown out otherwise.",
    "I carry around $5 bills to pass out to the homeless. One guy, who was begging by the freeway, was stunned when I gave it to him and said wow, thats a lot of money. I guess it is when the most you get is a dollar or two at a time.",
    "That is how most people think until we are forced to fend for ourselves as adults. It's human nature to care for each other. We shouldn't idolize those that do, we should ostracize those that don't.",
    "My little brothers do this with their allowance. It takes them months just to save up a dollar, and the whole time they're doing chores I can hear them getting all excited and talking about what they're going to buy with all the money they've saved. But the second we leave the house and they see a homeless person at an intersection they immediately give it away.",
    "As a kid, I was broke as hell, but my great grandparents had money. They would often send me to school with a 20 for the week for lunch. The way I would buy EVERYONE everything that Monday and starve the rest of the week. It felt so damn good to be able to pay for things for other people, people whose parents paid for school lunch quarterly and brought treats for the rest of the class. I often dream of winning the lottery to be able to do this with any/everyone I see struggling.",
    "Did you find another way to help people?",
    "I've never understood why more rich people don't just do this. Like giving things to other people just feels so good",
    "I was a bartender and server for most of my adult life and I dream of being rich just to leave giant tips at restaurants.",
    "yeah, this is not surprising at all. She donates almost a million dollars to animal shelters in nearly EVERY city she goes to. She gave her truckers 100k, and let me tell you, there are A LOT of them. She has a huge travelling circus and they are all well cared for. She probably does more than any artist of her fame and popularity",
    "Yeah... this comment right here is where I'm at. Personally, I do not like her music.. never have. I really don't get the appeal. But she's doing something very kind that MOST people at her level don't do. I'm sure there are plenty of problems people can have with her for various reasons, but stfu about her doing acts of kindness. Jeez.",
    "You can complain about a lot of what Taylor does and especially the use of private jets and such, but at the same time shes running a multi billion dollar business which does usually require the use of jets. She also tipped the crew of her tour a fuck ton. Shes gotten unbelievably rich(er) in the past 4 years and it seems she at the very least tries to give back.",
    "Some of the responses to your comment are absolutely wild. Some people really cannot see straight through their hatred of her yikes.",
    "She has always come across as genuinely kind, to me.",
    "She also seems to be incredibly gracious and well spoken in public. I don't see her making tweets that go viral and get mocked relentlessly, we don't see her even frown being booed at the superbowl! I've always appreciated that she's smart enough not to feed the media trolls",
    "Have you met the right?",
    "what is ETA short for in this context lol jw",
    "There is an entire subreddit dedicated to hating Taylor Swift. Internet is a weird place.",
    "> Taylor has many other things to bitch about Even most of that is weak.",
    "Yes. There is no need to be completely polar about everything. Praise the good stuff a person does even if you think theyre bad, point out the bad stuff a person does even if you think theyre good.",
    "Uggghh feel like I've read so much bad about her, but I'm thinking it's just jealousy? I'm betting someone will spin this as calculated. Anyway, she seems kind :)",
    "I'm pretty solidly indifferent to her overall (not meant as a bad thing), but I even don't understand all the hate either. I get randomly suggested Swift hate subs sometimes and it's just bizarre how many there are!",
    "People are stupid. Im unsure why everyone has so much hate. Im not a swifty, but thats a fucking class act right there. She didnt have to, but she did. She hit everyone there too with that cash. Good on her.",
    "Yep just yesterday I asked the guy at Walmart changing my tires if I could tip me and said he would get fired but thank you.",
    "That is such a cool move. When I worked jobs that were tipped, I remember the feeling I felt when someone tipped me really generously. I cant wait to be able to afford to do that same.",
    "Just to put a point on this: If you have a billion dollars, tipping someone $100 is giving away the same percentage of your net worth as someone who has $100,000 giving away literally one penny. Just a reminder that the only reason other billionaires don't do this constantly is that they can't be bothered. Taylor Swift can be bothered, at least some of the time. Kudos to her.",
    "What a boss.",
    "lived in LA, and a friend of a coworker was a bartender at a super well known celeb bar/restaurant. she LOVED whenever taylor came in because it essentially ensured she wasnt going home with less than $1k (they split tips so it would be divided amongst bartenders, busboys, hosts, waiters, etc). i know taylor gets a lot of shit but no one on this earth can ever accuse her of being stingy",
    "this picture kills me  reminds me of grandma slipping you money when parents aren't looking",
    "Lmaaao I have never seen this, thank you so much",
    "Seriously my favorite picture of her",
    "Me on payday",
    "What I love about this is she specifically carries money on her for this purpose. People this rich with handlers and stuff often dont pay for anything themselves, they have someone who carries their wallet for them. Hell, Im middle class and I never have cash on me unless its for a specific purpose.",
    "Not the kind of person that should've got booed at the superbowl. We as a country have completely lost the plot.",
    "I'm not a fan of her and some of the things she does, but this is a pretty classy move and I can respect that she seems to respect the people that got and keep her where she is. Also, just insane to imagine walking around with a few grand in my pocket just for tips for the day. Like keys, wallet, phone.... hmmm im forgetting something... oh shit forgot my fat stack of hundreds for tipping.",
    "It would make me so happy. If I ever somehow become wealthy Im going to tip everyone",
    "Most billionaires become billionaires by being severely mentally ill. Their brains dont work like the rest of us.",
    "Is that person hired to just roll joints for you? No, those are the rolled wads of cash I give out just to help people out or for tips or whatever. THATS my joint roller over there.",
    "I once met a woman who had a professional joint roller on staff. Just one way she wasted daddys money. She was, as you might imagine, not well.",
    "I think its partly generational and maybe cultural/regional. I never carry cash. But I dated a guy from rural Georgia who always had walkin around money in his wallet. My dad definitely carries cash too. If I know Im going to have to do cash tips Ill go to an ATM or get cash back. Also sometimes when you buy something off Marketplace/craigslist the seller prefers cash.",
    "In London many homeless (in central London anyway) have the card machines so you can tap and pay with Apple Pay. ",
    "A lot of hotels have started offering tipping QR codes for this purpose. Same thing at nail and hair salons where you are often not able to add a tip on your credit card.",
    "US is heading towards a cashless society like everywhere else but they are years behind Canada and most of Europe in that regard. Debit card payments, etransfers (bank to bank, not Venmo) and tap payment are all relatively recent to the US. Actually Im not sure if e transfers have caught on yet.",
    "For several years I never had cash on me. Lately though I always do. Lots of small local businesses have started adding a surcharge for paying with a card, so I get cash if Im going there and usually take out a little extra for a cushion. So the trend may be shifting a bit if this is happening in lots of places.",
    "I dont know. I served David Beckham at the restaurant I worked for once, and he did tip us 50, which is decent but not excessive. I never felt like he should have given more based on wealth. I appreciated even more that he was pleasant and nice to staff, which is definitely not a given for someone that famous.",
    "Performative money is still money .",
    "Let the girl perform all she wants!",
    "More celebrities and wealthy people should tip preformatively. I never heard anyone say. Wow how awful, I just got tipped performatively. Whats everyone so upset about. Besides, girl always has a camera on her is most her public life not going to be considered performative in order to keep her public image?",
    "It's not the workers who are complaining usually",
    "Exactly! I'd be damn grateful if a celeb wants to be performative by giving me some cash.",
    "A truck driver on her tours wife posted on social media all the drivers got $100,000 thank you.",
    "I don't think it's performative because it's literally nothing to her and also her body language isn't showing off a single thing",
    "Because every accusation is a confession with these shitbags. They're horrible people and can't fathom somebody with good parents was raised a decent person. She's under a crazy amount of pressure, should have had some kind of heel turn by now. But no, maybe she's just fine.",
    "Right? People make her out to be diabolical but I think shes genuinely a nice and caring person. shes generous, and thoughtful of the people around her.",
    "The worst is when people say things like, only $500?! Shes a billionaire!",
    "I don't know what more people want from her, tbh. I mean, come on. She donated to food banks in every city of her tour ffs. Just because she isn't giving away every penny doesn't make it any less nice when she does do something (which is OFTEN).",
    "Given shes followed by cameras and phone cameras I dont think she could do that quietly",
    "Im not a Taylor fan either- but she does a ton of charity. She visits Childrens hospitals all over the world when she tours, she fills food pantries in cities shes touring in, Ive heard of her donating to animal charities in cities she tours, etc. People love to hate people, especially when they are jealous.",
    "seriously, she's held to a much different standard than her peers, everything she does is wrong to someone. i've listened to her stuff casually but there's really no denying that she's generous and takes care of people when others wouldn't even think to do that.",
    "Louder for the people in the back!",
    "I saw a comment the other day calling her a Trump supporter. She literally endorsed his opponent! Some people are just haters and wont let a silly thing like reality stop them.",
    "People only want good deeds to be done secretly but to find out from others who tell everyone essentially. Someone could be the most generous and charitable person secretly (and happy for it to be kept secret) and youd never know but people will judge them because theyve not been outed by anyone yet.",
    "Yeah, my cousin works for artists setting up the stages - he actually missed the opportunity to do ERAS and he was pissed because the pay was better than any of the other tours hes worked on. And were talking very big names. She also gives good bonuses.",
    "And shes had some of the same band members since she started out! Amos and Paul for sure. Says a lot of her character and how she treats her band.",
    "I want a neon sign thats says whining about Taylor Swift online is not activism",
    "Shes only valued at a billion because thats how much her masters are worth & the value of her homes & properties and her companies. Not that it makes a difference, shes still insanely rich, but the money she actually has is not a billion lol",
    "Yeah I don't like her music either but everything I've seen about her leads me to believe she seems to be a decent human. However I don't think billionaires exist but I don't think she is evil for her wealth considering who you can compare her too. I also don't understand much of the hate she gets either.",
    "I dont personally care too much about whether or not its performative because we have actual billionaires buying the White House so like at least its a net positive for the people shes performatively giving money to",
    "Rich people used to build parks and schools and libraries for the public, it would be amazing to go back to that kind of rich people behavior!",
    "Performative cash is still cash",
    "She actually gave them more than Chipotle money and told them to go some where nice to eat dinner.",
    "Fan for life fr.",
    "It was Geraldine Viswanathan, the actress (who was in Drive Away Dolls with Margaret Qualley, and happened to be with her in Electric Lady Studios when Taylor showed up).",
    "I started to listen to Taylors music last year after not really being a fan for like 15 years. And the hate she gets has made me understand the song Shake It Off. Yes, I know the song is repetitive and the lyrics are simple. But I cant help but sing it in my head every time a thread like this one comes up. People who are determined to hate her will find a reason to complain about her no matter what she does. It must be so exhausting to have people pick apart every single thing you do. She has no choice to but to shake it off, because internalizing that constant, undeserved hatred would destroy a person.",
    "I think she gave her all the cash she had and told her not to go to chipotle and go somewhere a little nicer for her bday lol",
    "Yeah her security guy who stops with her is like FFS this again, we gotta go",
    "She did another set of bonuses at the end of the tour in 2024, bringing the total to $200 million",
    "Sure and I agree with that sentiment. But I still stand by saying its not performative. I think generally in American culture its a crutch and defensive reaction to call out charity as performative but even beyond that deeper cultural issue - if something is a habit done consistently over time it ceases to be performative.",
    "Yeah I meant 100k each, thanks for clarifying though.",
    "People who can keep friends for decades are decent people in my book. It's a really quick way to tell",
    "The fact shes stayed relevant in the industry for so many years in general is telling to me. People always wanna paint her to be this monster but like if she was so awful she would not have gone this far in her career.",
    "I remember an old interview she did with Letterman, she was pretty young, and mentioned health insurance/benefits for her tour staff, and he was surprised that she offered that, and she was surprised that he was surprised. I know, billionaires bad and all, but I think she takes care of her people and seems to be courteous to event staff too. And I know the Eras tour was making large food pantry donations in each city. It's not nothing. We can argue the ethics of being a billionaire or her carbon footprint or whatever, but those things are a net good.",
    "Thats what annoys me, when people complain seeing other people give any form of help. Performative, they can afford to give more, etc etc. Help is help, and some people are just bitter and sad.",
    "exactly like these people are there for money and money makes the world go round unfortunately so performative or not at the end of the day its making a real difference in someones life",
    "I've noticed that people absolutely hate nuance. They deeply desire everything to be black and white. I don't know if it's youth/immaturity (bc that is something you learn as you age) or what but it's kind of wild. The world never was and never will be black and white and neither will any single thing in it. The world exists exclusively in shades of grey. People online *strongly* resist this fact it's nuts",
    "And it also should be noted her private jet usage does not even register in the charts of top private jet celeb flights. Even during her tour. She was a scapegoat for that, because her name gets more engagement than for example Celine Dion or Beyonc, who were actually in the top 10. The actual top guy? Cant remember his name. Cause no one brings it up, cause no one knows - cause it wasnt a headline to use his name. It made better headlines to go after her, more clicks, more traffic, more ad views, better memes. Some people are salivating for any reason to jump on the hate train and the media fed them (the hate subs are extreme evidence of how desperate these folk are for a crumb of those crackers). But yet no one ever brings up that those other celebs must also be criticized for their jets or whatever other potential wrong theyve done in every post praising them. It may happen to an extent - after some news hits or something - but its not as pervasive. It is a curiously Taylor thing, that people have to say Im not a fan but I dont like her but this was good but. Of course shes not a saint. Everyone is nuanced. But its the way people have selective standards thats funny. Adding a moral and carbon footprint check to the end of every compliment. Like have at it, but give that energy for everyone. Hold every celeb to these standards. Direct the accusations to the right people. Anyway, Im just giving thumbs up to anyone being polite to service staff  god knows normal people cant even manage a thank you half the time",
    "100%. I'm not her target demo, i find her overall fame and persona a tad exhausting, but from everything i know of her, she is clearly on the good person side of the scales. So what's to hate? She's not for me, that's fine. Not everything is. I wish her well.",
    "Yep. Thats why its *bitch eating crackers*. Doesnt matter which way anything is done, quietly or loudly, shes always just over there eating her fucking crackers.",
    "I think this is true. She got stuck in Florida during a hurricane once and instead of hunkering down with the other rich people she went to a nursing home and volunteered, keeping them entertained by singing, helping to serve food, etc etc",
    "I dont care about her music, but shes a great role model for any young woman.",
    "Yeah I agree. I personally dont like her but I have zero negative to say about this. Regardless of her motives, as someone who used to be in the service industry, this wouldve made my day for sure.",
    "Always have been the American dream. Service Workers depends on tips",
    "And while I hate to defend the 1% needlessly, a lot of her net worth is tied up in the value of her masters; that shes never going to want to sell. She probably doesnt have a billion dollars in liquid cash which some people seem to wilfully ignore. Im sure she has more money in her checking account than most of us could earn in 10 lifetimes, but people also need to conceptualise how many people the Taylor Swift brand employs and supports too. Hundreds? Thousands? Security, assistants, house staff, managers, her family, drivers, band members, etc, and weve heard from her staff that she pays well and has better benefits. You have to be greedy to get the amount she has, and Im always for adequate taxation of the insanely rich, but people thinking celebs have millions and billions in liquid cash always irks me.",
    "Not just the truck drivers, right? Didnt she end up giving several million in total because she gave everyone from the tour a massive bonus?",
    "she also donated to hurricane helene, which is a lot more than a lot of celebs and rich people can say. appalachia pretty much got ignored",
    "She gave out a total of \\~$197,000,000 in bonuses for people who worked on the Eras tour. Bonuses, to be clear, not contractual pay.",
    "Yes, she donated to our Second Harvester's Food Bank in NOLA. The archdiocese of NOLA is now trying to take money from it to pay for sex abuse lawsuits. Yay religion!",

    "Idk personally all my best schemes and plots are when Im drunk.",
    "Taylor shaped hole in people's ethics",
    "everytime taylor donates/gives money i know the comments will be fully of hate like-",
    "The fact that people have tried to make this kind of hate happen is so so silly. Like what is she supposed to do to combat the (unfound) performative accusations? Stop giving unless she gets people to sign NDAs to never mention it and intentionally make the world believe that she's uncharitable when it does seem to come naturally to her? That's weird AF. Some of things she does is like, human decency (she tips waiters! she's cleaning up other peoples' trash from the suite herself!), but even holding a door for an old lady is probably \"performative\" to these people if someone gets a photo of it. This \"criticism\" isn't anything she needs to concern herself with because it seems to really only apply to her anyway.",
    "I dont think theres ever been a single story of someone claiming she was rude to them. Over a 20 year career thats extremely impressive.",
    "So happy you got to go to the tour! I also noticed this last year that she has hardly ever cancelled shows compared to other artists - none due to her own problems I think. She has the same backup singers and band for so many years, all her dancers praise her, I hardly hear anything bad from anyone who has interacted with her; all the hate I do read is speculative and projection. The only thing we can see her improve upon is being more climate conscious.",
    "Lmaooooo I just pictured JLo walking through afterward snatching those tips ",
    "Why not both? After my dad died, I stayed in a hotel for two weeks while I got things sorted out. He had left wads of money around the house and instead of taking it to the bank, I just tipped every hotel employee I saw, every day. It just felt so nice to be able to say thank you to the people who were helping me out during such a rough time. I am Italian and I watched my dad hand out wads of cash my whole life and it felt good to do it myself. Maintain my opinion that people who dont tip do not know what real joy feels like.",
    "I was a dishwasher in high school. I would eat off of people's plates. Almost 40 now and still healthy. Well, I think so anyway, I don't go to the doctor",

    "$5 is a lot of money lol coming from someone is is not homeless but always struggling with money",
    "I usually dont carry cash, but when I do and someone else is in need, I give it all to them. My philosophy is that they obviously need it more than I do at the moment, and I rarely have more than $30 anyway, so Id rather give it to them vs. separating or saying something callous about getting change for them. At least I can help them now, because I may not be able to in the future.",
    "She also donates to food banks in every city she performs.",
    "She didnt give her truckers 100k she gave all of her roadies 100k. Thats about 200 people if not more lol",
    "Exactly. I remember when she donated 100,000 to the Djs family who got shot at the chiefs parade after their Super Bowl win last year and people were so nasty saying she shouldve donated more and I also read she donated 10 million to the people in LA for the wildfires. She is a very kind and giving person apparently because she couldve done nothing.",
    "Yeah she was in town a few months ago and the hype was insane. Like, government getting involved and tons of news coverage and fans lined up before the sun came out to get merch. Now I'm a 37 year old dude, I have virtually no interest in Taylor Swift, but I couldn't believe the amount of people my age that were bothered by it. Like, even if you're not a fan, it's undeniable how much business she was bringing into town. And the stuff she's promoting are values like be nice to each other and loyal to good friends. Why anybody is bothered by it, I just don't know.",
    "My buddy Is a stage hand for some huge venues in Denver. He has worked shows that were headlined by Taylor Swift, pink, and other big name artist. Pink didnt allow the stagehands and other workers too even look her away. She even requested at times for no one else be in the room with her.",
    "She also has lowered that jet use over the last two years while other celebrities have increased their use and dont get the same blowback or even brought into the private jet conversation much. Travis Scott comes to mind.",
    "Can you imagine the craziness if she actually went to an airport and flew commercial.",
    "And she buys the carbon credits for it. She obviously isnt in a position to feasibly NOT fly private but she offsets it. At the same time whats the other option? She just NOT support climate change and stuff? Its like telling someone who supports climate change and advocated for legislative changes and tries to do what they feasibly can to help to stop driving to work. Awareness and acceptance are important and thats how she can best help.",
    "lol I had to unfollow the thread  wild bc I thought I was a Taylor hater but ig not lol",
    "I don't understand how people hate her. I've heard some of her songs and like a few of them, not a fan by any means. But hate her? Has she done something controversial that I missed?",

    "I've seen people go, \"yeah, but that's nothing to her\" because she's so rich. And I think, plenty of rich people are stingy af, so if she was, it'd be nothing to her to NOT tip. She's well known to be generous. I'm not a Swiftie, but I think it's cool that she takes care of her own staff and staff at these venues. Plus I read that her tour made huge food pantry donations at each stop for Eras, which I think is great. I would love to be able to afford to be really generous. I put myself through college with tips from a restaurant job. I've never been rich, but I always try to tip as generously as I can because I know what it's like to depend on that income.",
    "Exactly. I worked restaurants for a long time and I remember what a difference even just 2 to 5 dollars over 25% would make for my day and so when Im tipping I remember that those couple extra bucks probably arent going to break my bank but theyre gonna make my servers day better.",
    "i worked at a restaurant where this one guy would come in and give $20 to every single person he interacted with. i was just a hostess and it would seriously make the whole night. ive always wanted to be rich enough to do that",
    "When I made more money I used to overtip all the time even tho I could have used that money to pay down student loans. I just felt so guilty for making six figures after working a lot of low paying retail jobs for a lot of my early 20s .",
    "My granny would slip me a 20 spot and tell me, go buy yerself a stick a gum every time. I choose to imagine Taylor saying this as well",
    "thats exactly what i was thinking, shes probably handing out hard candies too",

    "Now dont spend it all in one place.  a grandma probably",
    "Yeah my dad (who I dont talk to) is super rich and always told us You dont stay rich by sharing. Always bugged me as a kid.

    "Exactly. Im not going to fault her for doing this no matter the reason and its also nice that she went and did it herself.",
    "Heres the thing about performative money: In capitalism, the only form of power is money. Giving people money is literally empowering them. The reason is unimportant. In capitalism, the absence of power (money)? Eventually, that is violence.",

    "I've always hated that take. It might be a drop in the bucket for Taylor, but I think she understands the difference a few hundred dollars can make to someone who isn't a billionaire.",
    "People dont understand that net worth isnt what you have in your account. Too many dumb fcks on this internet thing",
    "That always annoys me so much. Yeah she wouldnt notice if that amount disappears from her account, but to me that would be huge sum of money to get and would change a few things in my life.",
    "People also confuse net worth with cash in the bank. Obviously many billionaires abuse the system by leveraging their debt to pull shit like avoiding taxes BUT it doesn't change my point that a large amount of people think Taylor has a billion sitting in her chequing account.",
    "And people only knew because some of the food banks publicly thanked her. She also donated whats most likely 10 million dollars to organizations helping with the LA fires recently.",
    "Nothing she does would make some people happy. Just the fact that Trump 'doesn't like her!' makes it so that she can't do ANYTHING right to a chunk of cult members.",
    "She quietly donated 25k to a cat rescue I work with.",
    "she literally does. so many stories came out after the tour of how she had secretly donated to shelters and other organizations in each city",
    "Yeah, about the only valid criticisms one can have for her are that she exploits her fans by releasing 1000 variants of her albums and that she flies private. The former is a standard industry practice at this point. As for the latter... sure, she travels too much. But I don't think people realize that if she wants to travel, she almost HAS to fly private. A car isn't always fast enough and wouldn't get her to Europe or Asia. Plus, someone of her fame level would shut down an airport if she flew commercial. There's ways of mitigating this but I think she's just too famous.",
    "And once theyre outed people call it performative as though it no longer counts for anything. Just a PR move, and of *course* the info was leaked.",
    "YES  Ill take one too. I always see these online activists say things like well she only donated .01% of her wealth, thats nothing for a billionaire. Ok sis, are you donating .01% of your wealth anytime soon?",
    "Exactly! Everything is kind of performative except for charity given in secret. Taylor is awesome for this",
    "They still do, or at least they sponsor them. Thats why you see peoples names on buildings or wings or buildings. All that is a tax write-off in the US though, so then they get out of paying taxes.",
    "Yeah I remember that. I think she gave them a couple hundred bucks",
    "Thank you!! One of my favorite wholesome Taylor stories but I couldnt remember who it was ",
    "Shake It Off is a fun song and Ill never understand the hate. People love Hit Me Baby One More Time or Sk8er Boi (as do I) and both have equally silly lyrics. They are pop songs, not Shakespearean sonnets.",

    "Wow I remember hearing about that but I forgot. Thats a ton of money",
    "Agreed. I'm a fan of Harry Styles and he's had the exact same line up since he went solo. He even set up his drummer and guitarist who are now married and Harry is godfather to their child. He says that he's just the front man for the best band.",
    "To their credit, both Taylor and Travis still have people in their respective entourages who they have been friends with since high school.",
    "And honestly kinda goes the other way for me, too. Ive noticed people who cant keep or maintain friendships are (more often than not) not good people",
    "Yeah, not a knock at TS but there are plenty of celebs with very longstanding, steady careers that are horrible people.",
    "Thats not a factor to judge someone being a good person at all. Plenty of celebrities with long careers are established to be awful. Not saying anything about TS either way, just that logic in general.",
    "I remember a lot of people talking about how she gave a bunch of money away during the pandemic. It was never really published and the only reason anyone knew about it was because the people being helped came out and talked about how she gave them money. Im sure there were others who never publicly talked about it. Like yes she is very rich and can afford to give more but the fact that she does shit like that makes her a complete outlier.",
    "She could literally have someone on her payroll whose sole job was to handle tipping and folks would be like what she cant do it herself? She needs someone else to tip the peasants? She could tip more if she wasnt paying that person like omg give it a rest.",
    "Which is so silly, because she *also* does and gives more than just this",
    "Yeah, I'm studying environmental related stuff in my masters and my friends legit prefer taking buses and trains over flights and eat vegan or vegetarian (including me). And I'm pretty much a swiftie and my environmentalist friends barely go into hate rants about her private jets when I say anything about her. If you ask them they'd obviously say taking a private jet like that is selfish (so do I) but yeah they seem to enjoy her music (and humor me at karaoke) and her haters online seem a bit unhinged to me...",

Neither one of these celebrities seems to be \"private jet\" rich and never gets talked about. A lot of people are doing what Taylor does but she gets targeted. Even the Kardashians are worse.",
    "God I HATE the private jet discourse so much because even if someone flies a jet all the time, THE FOSSIL FUEL COMPANIES HAVE BEEN FUCKING UP THE ENVIRONMENT FOR LITERALLY 100 YEARS. And that doesnt even include coal mining or coal burning plants. Yes they could stand to use their jets less but the amount of people using private jets like that is barely a drop in the bucket of how much climate damage big corporations have done over the past few hundred years.",
    "also like, she's a popstar, not an activist, a legislator or a CEO of a global commodities company. of course she, like all of us, does wrong shit and it's catapulted by her wealth, but i'm not usually looking at taylor swift to check whether her actions are more or less problematic when we have literal government takeovers, people burning forests to raise cattle and nestle contaminating water streams.",
    "Apparently she opens her mouth too much and has the body of a washboard are some of the legitimate reasons given as to why she deserves to be dragged on social media.",
    "I truly adore that saying.",
    " this is so freaking sweet and even would've considered unnecessary of the average person - who does that while stuck in a city during a hurricane?? My point is, even *normal* people wouldn't do something like that! It goes to show how big her heart is and what a generous spirit she has. Wow, this story just totally made my day. I've always liked Kristin Bell but this just confirms for me why I felt drawn to her. What a human.",
    "wow this is great.",
    "This drives me nuts too. I think last time the music she owns was valued around $500 million. She gives a lot of money away and she has been paying her crew generously for years. She gives them full benefits and healthcare and has since she was a teenager. I know theres to snark on her about, but her generosity is not one.",
    "\\*whispers\\* I think it is smart that she employs her family instead of just handing them money. They work for her and do important stuff at that like her brother managers her catalogue, but they also get a nicer life than anyone can imagine.",
    "Yeah, close to $200 million in bonuses went to her team",
    "I think so. I remember hearing about her dancers getting a big bonus",
    "Yeah, it was around $50k for each person on the crew, from techs, roadies, stylist, etc. My brother is a professional tour tech for a band and knows a couple of people who were on the Eras crew. What a lot of people dont realize is that the people who work behind the scenes for touring bands/musicians are essentially independent contractors, so they only get paid when theyre on the road and have to find other gigs to fill the gaps if the band they usually work for is not currently touring. Some bands keep some of their crew on retainer and pay them an annual salary so theyre available when needed for touring, but thats not the norm for the workers outside of the specialized tech roles. Im sure those bonuses were a huge deal for that crew.",

    "Based on her comments in the Time Person of the Year interview and her openness in TTPD lyrics, I genuinely think she really doesnt care about public opinion anymore. She realised long ago (snake gate mainly but from many incidents), that you cant control if people will gossip, talk shit and like you or hate you, so you might as well do what you want. The only thing that will last is the music she makes. In ten or twenty years no one will give a shit what people were saying on Reddit or Instagram.",
    "I was thinking what if she got one her bodyguards to hand out tips. A full time employee just dedicated to hand out tips under the radar. But then i realized how fucking ridiculous that notion is. If tay wants to give she should just give. And the us should stop normalizing not giving a wage you can live on so youre reliant on strangers generosity.",

    "that's not really how tax write-offs work. What happens is that they don't pay taxes on the money they donate (up to 50% of their income). Because Taylor has had so much income this year, she actually needs to make huge donations (if she wants the tax credit on it). Also, tipping workers is not a donation, and she can't deduct it. In fact, she likely has to pay the gift tax on it in addition to normal income taxes. (in the US, the giver of a gift has to pay taxes instead of the reciever. A tip can be payment for services, but if you're giving $100 tips.. the IRS is not going to be happy with you).",

There was one time a friend told me to look up a song of his when I mentioned liking his music a lot now. She told me not to watch the music video though, told me it would probably make me cry cause a fish is in emotional distress.

I am working in this way too by the way, like many many many people who are not artists. If she wanted to be radical, she could go up there advocating for universal health care.

There are working class artists who arent being properly compensated for their time or their art because they dont have health insurance through their employer (the labels). I consider my benefits package part of my pay and artists working for labels should have similar benefits from the companies they make money for. And yes, we need universal healthcare. 100%.",

    "I'm seeing something similar in publishing and there are some new authors calling out publishers for not paying a livable wage. But most writers never were making much money from it. The myth/allure of the \"struggling artist\" exists for a reason. They were living out of their vans, working at bars, writing books/music on the side waiting to make it big. (Before that, they were sponsored by rich people.) But it's so much harder to be that kind of artist today. Nobody can afford to go live alone in a cabin for a year to write the next great american novel or self fund their own tour. That's the real issue and it's not an industry problem, that's an overall cost of living problem. It's good that young people today are more political and care more about things like universal healthcare and speak up about these things. But there's also a disconnect because with social media today anyone can be famous, and they all expect to be able to make money off their side hustle/ tik toks/ self published book/ garage band. It never worked like that, and it actually can't work like that. Not everyone can be a full-time artist. This isn't a dig on Chappell, but I'm just not sure who she means when she talks about emerging artists and how the industry is supposed to support every up and coming musician who maybe has a future hit.",

They keep their membership when the are dropped, but have to qualify with earning (27k of covered earnings) which is very difficult if they aren't signed. There was just an article in billboard where one of the heads of SAG-AFTRA talked about going up to Chappelle at the Grammys and telling her \"you know, umm... you already had insurance.\" (you can just turn off javascript to read the article). It's very possible she wasn't even aware. Very obviously the article criticizing her wasn't aware... because he would have said something if he was!",

It misses the direction we're moving and also it doesn't even address the problems she was talking about. I wouldn't care as much (I genuinely don't expect artists to be super into policy details) if it wasn't for how many young people clearly think she's more informed than she is. She has the spirit but there's a lot of refinement needed and it's troubling to me if people are genuinely seeing her as an influential and important voice in these convos I liked lady Gaga a lot but I did not see Gaga as a political sage.",

    "She said that she lost health insurance after being dropped by her record label though, during Covid. So what you're saying about SAG-AFTRA likely not covering her due to the min earnings qualifier is likely quite relevant here: *\"I got signed so youngI got signed as a minor. When I got dropped, I had zero job experience under my belt, and like most people, I had quite a difficult time finding a job in the pandemic and [could not] afford insurance. It was devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and dehumanized. If my label had prioritized it, I could have been provided care for a company I was giving everything to. Record labels need to treat their artists as valuable employees with a livable wage and health insurance and protection.*",
    "Yes, but only if she joined SAG-AFTRA, which requires an initiation fee of $3000, plus $232 in base fees, plus 1.5% of earnings (and then plus the $187/mo). Thats out of reach for a lot of struggling artists who would rather take their chances on not needing medical care.",
    "Also she just turned 26 last year so she could have been on her parents insurance while between labels. She was eligible until she turned 26. Admittedly that isnt a choice for older artists but it would have been for her",
    "Based on another comment, yes they do",
    "She also mentioned livable wages and its important to pay attention how the narrative has dropped that part completely and pivoted to ways she technically coulda maybe had health insurance through union agreements with enrollment fees and subsidiary buy in The main focus should be : labor deserves fair wages and protections at the expense of executive profits , not ah well SAG-AFTRA could have, technically",
    "It's wild that even though she's one of the only mainstream artists talking about this stuff that publicly yet it's still not good enough for some. Sure she could have proposed ways to fix things, but it was a GRAMMYS speech.",
    "Also, and to be clear I LOVE her music and really am a fan, but what Im confused about is its a good point that no one should pay out of pocket for insurance but if for now we do theres a lot of people who several hundred a month is a lot more to them than a celebrity. Unless Im missing something",
    "Yes, but only if she joined SAG-AFTRA, which requires an initiation fee of $3000, plus $232 in base fees, plus 1.5% of earnings (and then plus the $187/mo). Thats out of reach for a lot of struggling artists who would rather take their chances on not needing medical care.",
    "I was actually just discussing with my husband and wondering if musicians have access to a union like SAG. This answers that. Interesting. Thank you. I will say, that for some people $167/month might as well be a million. As a young, struggling artist she may have had to choose between food/shelter and health insurance. I know that growing up my mom had to make some tough choices like that just to keep the lights on as a struggling single mother. All that being said, I dont know Chappells personal story or exactly what choices she faced but I know she took an opportunity to speak up for others and bring attention to an issue I hadnt really thought about before. I appreciate that and I hope she chooses to donate whether this record exec does or not.",

Supports LGBTQ but then goes off on some bullshit rant about Kamala and the Dems and the idiotic both sides argument. Says artists should receive healthcare in her Grammy speech. Which now looks like she just has a personal grievance because doesnt actually care about the issue, she just wants to be petty. She doesnt WANT her label to give her healthcare, because then she doesnt technically own her music because shed be an employee of a company. Just like the rest of us. Nobody on her team, the people supporting her, are getting healthcare btw. Asks for free shit from people (nail techs) supporting musicians. Oh okay, so you want people to be supported and given healthcare but you dont want to support people supporting you?? She literally speed ran her way to rich elite status, and gives off the vibe that we are all peasants below her and should listen to whatever she says as gospel",
    "I think this is more challenging the complacency of the records/music industry executives rather than anything else. The label executive does not have a point. You can't hide behind \"I'm already a villain/a-hole, so morals don't mean anything to me\" Although, I could see an \"Oh? I'll go do that. And I'm also going to donate to a nail company to mock you.\"",

    "But she wasnt even the one who asked for free nails? It was supposedly her manager (or whoever Alexandria is), although the email looked fake as hell. We dont even know that chappell is aware of that whole exchange.

I think it was last year that some small business on TikTok was super excited about some huge Influencer reaching out to get jewelry made for an award show; only for the Influencer to comment on the video and say that they had never reached out and didn't know what the person was talking about. Turned out, it was a scammer who had a phishing email. It looked legit and was identical to the Influencer's actual email. But it wasn't actually them. And the comments were full of other businesses sharing their own experiences people claiming they were associated with a celebrity/model/influencer asking for free things and promising promo that never came.",

I find its best to separate the art from the artist",
    "I dont stan anyone I just find it hilarious how quickly people are to tear a woman down who calls out exploitative practices. Refusing benefits and worker rights to thousands of people is not the same as trying to get free nails but yall need her to be a hypocrite so you can buy your SHEIN hauls without feeling bad about it I guess.",
    "Why do you think a year old story from her old management team - that misspells her name - is showing up now that she has spoken about something that pisses off executives? Some of you are so easy to manipulate.",
    "Yeah... I think that's what happened. In fact... I wonder if the reason she's doing background vocals on Sour was because Dan Nigro was trying to get her covered employment so she could qualify for insurance. The real issue is that she got dropped in 2020. This both was horrible for her... it was also a really really stupid decision! Atlantic lost a ton of money on her. Island has made a fortune! This is the year of breakout artists. And yet... all these artists were \"in development' for a really long time. Charli XCX was signed (to asylum) in 2010... she had it the easiest because she has written over the years a number of unbelievably big hits for other artists (I love it, and Senorita). Sabrina Carpenter was first signed (to Hollywood Records) in 2015. Chappelle was signed to atlantic in 2015. Gracie Abrams was signed in either late 2018 or early 2019. So all of these artists have been working for years for record labels, making very little money (Charli did the best), and suddenly 10 years later they break out. Both Sabrina and Chappelle have been on two different labels! If this is how long it takes to break out, this isn't sustainable.",
    "i'm not sure that's true. Just looking at the SAG-AFTRA benefits page, it seems that artists on label rosters automatically qualify. I do know that labels pay a ton of money to the musicians unions in Union Exploitation Charges (several points on every record), plus a fee for every new artist on their roster. These charges sometimes come up in record deals (artists on distro deals are often required to pay them instead of the labels) The deal the labels have with the unions is quite different than the deal for motion pictures...",
    "Depending on what kind of insurance her parents even have and if they could afford to cover her as an add on. Many of my friends parents dropped them early to save money and said it was on them to find a job with insurance.",
    "I work as a professional musician and honestly, music is a bit of a weird one for this. You get signed as a contractor, which gives you the ability to maintain some ownership over your music, and benefit more significantly if you succeed. If musicians become employees, they will then have the same rights to their IP as an Apple engineer would have over the apps they built while they were working at Apple (none). Additionally, the vast majority of musicians who sign record contracts are not going to be profitable investments. Its very much a shotgun game where you go broad and hope to hit with one or two. So if labels had to start paying all of their artists $40k/ year or whatever, they would basically have to stop signing people (my first advance was something like 1000). If you got dropped from a contract where you were paid a small advance, youre not going to get signed to one where you have to be paid many times more for a longer period of time, with the funds not being tied to any performance metrics. Basically, a pretty huge amount of want-to-be entertainers dont really provide any real value to society, so treating them like factory workers, whose wage is tied to their real output doesnt really make sense.",
    "Yeah I mean my continuous issue with Chappell is while I probably agree with 90% of her politics, she makes a lot of poorly phrased political statements. People will not soundbite your intentions, plan accordingly (that's why most artists keep it vague and to rehearsed lines) And I do care a LOT about this one. ESC is not the way, it's literally the problem. Don't throw ESC out there if you do not substantially and meaningfully ESC. And I cannot think of an industry where that makes less sense. Your statement is 1000x better. She should have said that lol And I really wouldn't care that much if she wasn't continually propped up as having better more concise speech than she does. People say she is 100% correct and it's like.....well her heart is in the right place. They say she doesn't miss and it's like.....she's always in the neighborhood. They say she's a socialist queen.....this is literally the exact opposite of socialism, this is actually a distinctly private market capitalist solution. I just need people to stop getting so much of their policy rhetoric from a pop star. If this is meaningfully shaping the conversation, then we're fucked. I don't need musicians to be super into the details. But if the majority of online progressives don't see the incoherence with pushing for ESC in 2025 as a respond to the large scale unemployment of the pandemic..... we're fucking doomed as a nation.",
    "That is very true, but the conversations surrounding the healthcare and health insurance industries need to continue to happen no matter who is talking about it, we need to keep talking about it because talking becomes actions. This is a right we must fight for so any and every conversation about it needs to happen and celebrities talking about it is important because the media will actually report on it, they arent going to report on all the people complaining online about it. I think its also important to note that Chappell may be super famous, a few years ago, she wasnt so she probably doesnt have as much money as people thinks she does. Sure she makes a lot put she also has to pay a lot of people out of that AND cover her own healthcare. Also, if celebrities are complaining about healthcare then you know its getting to be a huge issue. Either way all these conversations about it are what eventually leads to change.. so the criticism is a bit counterproductive.",
    "Someone just listed the SAG entrance stuff and honestly it's better than what a lot of people deal with. Especially since union dues and health insurance are tax deductible. I'm willing to bet 2020 Chappell was making more than my mom and apparently had a way better insurance offer than my mom could get. Idk I do think her overall story is a good one. Ife gotten emotional at it before....but the way she's politicizing it feels out of touch and sour. Like this *is* fairly common stuff, and to frame this as anything other than a call to better collective bargaining seems disconnected. You think your employer is just gonna stip being a dick if you ask nicely? Pay your union dues and get organizing like the rest of us ma'am",
    "I didnt even think of initiation fees and dues and such. Entirely out of reach for young struggling artists.",
    "How much was her signing deal for? Because it's really hard for me to feel bad someone chose not to pay union dues and is upset they don't get the benefits of unionization. 3000 is not an unusual deductible amount, and that is presumably a one time fee rather than annual.. It seems like we've just circles back to her maybe not understanding the landscape for the fact ESC is not only not the solutions, it's like 2/3 of the problem",
    "There are actually two unions. Vocalists are represented by SAG-AFTRA, instrumentalists by American Federation of Musicians (AFM). Some artists are members of both. SAG-AFTRA has better benefits. Artists signed to major labels automatically become eligible for benefits. This is not true for artists on indie labels.",
    "She's completely correct about Kamala Harris and the rest of the Dems, I don't think she made an idiotic argument at all. You honestly just seem very mad.",
    "I dont think it is a good point, and it makes him look extra slimy, but these scum have never been in art to promote it with honesty or take care of artists. As her star continues to rise and her platform Does, she can continue to use her platform her tons of ways that arent financial- I just wouldnt be surprised that a scumbag used this excuse. Again his point is I have always and will always be trash it doesnt make it right, I just dont think we can solely rely on these folks to change",
    "We dont know that she wasnt aware, either. What we do know is that she is *heavily* involved in curating all her looks. She works with her team rather than letting them work for her. So its a very real possibility that she knew what was going on as well.",
    "I think people are saying that if you are demanding an entire industry changes the way it compensates artists, it looks bad if your small team is trying to get completely free labor out of people who are trying to just get by.",
    "Could I trouble you for an egg in this troubling time? I'll repay you with exposure to my 3 Bluesky followers.",
    "Ok, she literally provided proof but sure, rather than look at that just talk about your anecdotal experiences instead lol",

    "The comment that responded to you telling you that it wasn't messy has more upvotes and now you are being backhanded again which makes me think your comment was actually backhanded.",
    "You guys are quick to defend her EVERY move which is weird. I can be happy that she addressed healthcare for artists and support that while at the same time question why she is asking another artist for free work. Every artist should be treated fairly and should be paid for their work. At the end of the day, its about that. People are quick to yell youre tearing a woman down without understanding that its a valid criticism of another human being. Doesnt mean shes a bad person but this is for sure easy to address",
    "Okay conspiracy theorist lol. And the person who sent the email is still on her team. The nail artist is obviously responding to her Grammy speech. Its cool that CR advocates for healthcare and treating artists fairly but she should also do the same. Obviously its possible she wasnt aware of it but anything her team does is a reflection of her and it wouldve been easy to address",
    "Qualifying is not the same as joining. Qualifying means youre eligible to join, but you then still need to actually join. Perhaps you can negotiate with your label to include the fees in your contract? But I doubt a newly signed artist would have that kind of bargaining power.",
    "Also her parents live in Missouri. She did move back with them for a while",
    "Yeah that happened to me. My parents dropped me at 19 because my dads job refused to cover us at all so my dad would have had to pay out of pocket.",
    "Her mom is a veterinarian and her dad is an RN so I would imagine they could handle the cost tbh",
    "I think it's well intentioned but I think people need to recognize the details are everything. Just say \"healthcare is a human right\" or something vague about how keeping people locked out of healthcare is unacceptable. ESC works for middle to high earners really well. The higher up the income ladder you go, the better deal it becomes. The power you go, the shittier it gets. Right now theres this huge Medicaid gap where a lot of people are not able to get Medicaid, but cannot get an actual real fucking plan they can use, because the costs are astronomical. THAT is the core problem. Insurance works really good for rich people, we have a safety net for absolutely poverty, and we are fucking over the lower class workers. That precise segment is who the ESC primarily fails. ESC isnt the solutions. It's literally like 2/3 of the problem. And it espeically showed what a bad system is during the pandemic when we saw people getting laid off en masse and realized \"oh wow it's also just really stupid to tie these things together for other reasons as well\". It wouldn't help artist like Chappell. They are getting fucked over. They do lack basic security. But ESC is ...it's nothing in practice. It's cost inaccessible, it would increase the rate at which they get dropped, and they all still would have found themselves with no money and no prospects and no insurance in 2020. That's the problem. Is we keep doubling down on ESC like you can bootstrap your way out of insurability and it's just not true. Employers will never do it willingly. It makes the employees too expensive to offer good insurance, cause they're also getting shafted by insurance. It's a really complex tangled web of fucked upness and it's really important to emphasize over and over and over that ESC does not actually meaningfully help poor people. Most cannot actually see their doctor if they're insured at all. A huge chunk who are technically offered go without so they can buy luxuries like food and a car which gets them to their shitty job",
    "you'd be surprised. Chapelle was 5 years into her record contract in 2020... she had sold essentially zero music (one, not popular ep). She probably saw precisely zero income from Atlantic, after her advance, and despite rumors that they spend their advance on fancy cars and champaign, most artists do actually use their advance to pay their recording costs.",
    "Thank you. Im glad to have learned something new today.",
    "shes completely correct and ur completely correct and this person is very mad  keep iconing in these comments like they love to hate her for not endorsing kamala due to her waffling on a genocide. the queer community stands with other marginalized communities historically and today, and as a lesbian myself she represents our community amazingly ",
    "Trump is about to make being transgender illegal LMAO. He just banned them from womens sports. He signed an executive order that said women are biologically female, men are biologically male. Effectively getting rid of any protections for trans people. The dems and Kamala support trans and gay rights and have for a while now. How can you support trans and gay rights while also demonizing those that want to protect you?? Just shows you birds of a feather flock together. Shes a hypocrite and you are too LOL",

    "She should have used the $3000 to join the union is my point. That should literally be the first thing you do. Unsigned artists hustle for studio time. I known this for a fact. And they'd jump for the chance to join a professional union. It just really seems like we keep circling around the same \"universal healthcare because ESC is stupid\". Where if you insist on an industry specific talking point, it's higher pay and the union. Not ESC. She wouldn't have been able to afford ESC if she can't afford union dues. Again, the union insurance is a lot better than a lot of ESC plans. If she's gonna keep delving into nuanced political issues, she should be ready for nuanced political pushback analysis. Otherwise just say \"fuck the industry, healthcare is a human right\". I am entirely fine with artists keeping it vague.",

    "You don't get those benefits unless you're working though, and by \"working\" they mean making money. Someone further upthread said you had to make 27k yearly income as a recording artist to qualify for union insurance. I have a friend working in film, not quite the same, but similar. You don't just \"get\" benefits - you have to work your ass off to make hours to qualify for the union, and if something happens to interrupt those hours/earnings qualifying you.... you get dropped. So the union support is still mostly predicated on the stability of your career, it's not a safety net in the way you're thinking for many smaller artists. You don't know if she paid into the union or not either, I'm guessing. It's just frustrating when artists talk about problems in the art industry everyone is ready to come out and share that things are harder outside of the art world without acknowledging that all of this works in a very different way. And tbh it ends up sounding like \"artists should just get real jobs\" a lot of the time. There are ways to improve this - older seasoned artists with high income could pay more in dues, record labels could be required to pay into unions so artists could have more stable coverage, and in that way once you qualify you wouldn't be dropped as a newer or lower income artist when tines get rough.",

    "I didn't say that. I said if she's gonna make a VERY specific demand which doubles down on the way healthcare is broke while public policy advocates are pushing in the exact opposite direction, then kind of need a coherent explanation Does she think if she's bringing in no money they're gonna pay $500/month in her behalf? If she wants to be an employee, they're gonna fire her even sooner. That's just the reality of labor..if you're not bringing in money, if you're red in the books, they cut you. That IS every industry including the \"real\" jobs. I'm not putting art as lesser than real jobs. I'm questioning if Chappell has actually meaningfully thought about what she just asked for. Because it doesn't make sense to me It seems like they just need higher pay. Probably like a union version of COBRA. I don't understand the thought process of ESC would have helped her If you can't afford the union dues, you can't afford ESC deductibles. If you arent bringing in enough to qualify for the union .....you're not making enough to qualify for your label paying your insurance premiums. It just seems like *at best* a lateral move, probably a net negative. And wasn't what she should have asked for. (Which was more money and universal healthcare or like expanded Medicaid, getting the union to lower the threshold so there isn't a gap between Medicaid and insurance, etc) I just don't think artists should ask for very specific things unless they actually have thought through that specific thing. And considering how left she is and how exploitative she understands the industry is and the fact she was presumably in poverty ....I'm not understanding how she arrived as ESC The entire problem is that healthcare tired to labor doesn't make sense, and Medicaid limits are way too fucking low so people cannot reasonably buy in. So there's a huge gap. It's *not* unique to her industry, and I think ESC seems really poor suited to the industry *because* they're not typical employees",

Cause and effect.",

    "it was proven via screen recording the email was real. ppl saying it was only brought up after the grammys for clout are deliberately ignoring the context. the nail tech only came forward after chappell went on stage and whined about how her label wasnt compensating her and other artists fairly. its extremely hypocritical for her and her fans to rally behind compensation for artists but then ignore and put down smaller artists when they ask for compensation from her.",
    "lol what!? Okay lol. Theres actual video proof of it. Yall are just weird stans",
    "She's addressing a completely different kind of work than employment where you work for someone and are their outright employee. The arts and artists really function on very different forms of employment and reimbursement and it's very difficult to compare if you haven't worked in that area, and that's why \"just get real employment\" = ends up sounding like just saying artists should just, like, not work in arts if they want better conditions. I don't just mean music, like theatre, fine arts, etc, all use employment and funding models that tend to stray from the \"x company employs me and I do what they say in exchange for y\", which makes complete sense if you think about the type of work done. Saying just get a job that's a \"normal\" job - okay, but artists deserve to be able to ask for better working conditions as well, even if you don't understand how how that kind of work is often done or don't value it. I've been an independent artist and I've been in STEM and it's foolish to think that arts don't matter and artists should just get \"real\" jobs if they want stability, art is essential to a healthy society. And no, the US is not healthy right now, and I will always disagree with people who think asking for more and better is the problem.",

If we had national healthcare, this wouldn't be an issue for anyone.",

So the issue is they don't get paid to weather through rough spots, and also individual plans for self employed people are *super* expensive.

    "her stylist allegedly tried to pay a nail technician (? im not sure if thats the correct term for the occupation?) in exposure about a year ago, right before chappell went viral.",
    "Super briefly, a story broke recently (I want to say yesterday?) that her stylist had asked nail artists to send nail sets for Chappell to wear on stage. Only compensation was exposure. The incident happened long ago but it looks like she has the same team now, and it left a bad taste in peoples mouths, especially coming from someone who often speaks on fair compensation for artists. Chappells message is still  imo, but the hypocrisy isnt a good look.",
    "It's always easy to tell other people what to do with their money. It's hard to actually do it yourself.",
    "I think everyone is guilty of this by default. And yes, many celebs are this because of profits. I disagree that chappel is this (right now), and I do think its unfair to label her as this just because some other pop stars use relatability as a parasocial marketing strategy. But getting up at a podium and standing up for human decency during a time when people are recognizing your work with an award is nothing to scoff at. Wish more people would do it instead of plugging their next album or even thanking god. It gets people talking at minimum. Hopefully it gets people thinking. And possibly, enacting change. If anything, an artist who has been working for a long time without accolades or buttloads of money who finds themself suddenly with a microphone in a room full of the most important (ie wealthy) people of their industry? That could do something. If anything shes fallen out of grace with the academy. So I dont see it as performative at this point.",
    "Poor poor thing. Is there a go fund me?",
    "Well the article is asking her to actually DO something about it instead of just talking about it. I don't think it's a big ask. Plenty of celebrities talk and commiserate. Less actually work for change and even better, others simply take action without the need for accolades.",

    "The whole point is that it shouldn't be that way. Are you saying you are happy that health insurance is tied to employment contracts? That's a very bold and bootlicker stance of you. Or are you just an internet contrarion who likes to rile ppl up with dog shit, ice cold takes?",
    "It subsidises anyone who has been a taxpayer in the country and their dependants etc. Tourists need travel insurance etc but yeah. How broken you poor americans really are. ",
    "Healthcare should be, and in many countries is a fundamental human right. Access to it should not be dependent on what job you hold or if you hold any job.",
    "Even in a 9-5 job with health insurance you are subsidizing healthcare for everyone in your group...",
    "Its not news to anyone. Theyre saying it *shouldnt* be that way, not that it isnt. Every single developed country on the planet provides healthcare, aside from one.",
    "A lot of us don't think one's access to health insurance should be tied to the industry one chooses to work in. Why do you think it should be that way?",
    "Why is healthcare special treatment for anybody, including celebrities?",
    "Fair pay and health care is special treatment, what will these mollycoddled divas demand next? MY GOD",
    "In most developed countries she wouldn't have to pay out of her own pocket. Universal healthcare would cover it and if she HAD health insurance which many people in other developed countries have even with universal healthcare then she could CHOOSE to go private... but would be safe in the fact that all the years of her working and contributing to society meant she would be covered and she would be able to get better and back to work and contributing to society again.",
    "most countries have universal healthcare. those places have musicians, toilet-scrubbers and all types of workers. theres nothing wrong with chappell roan, a big artist, raising concerns about smaller artists not being able to afford healthcare. if you dont value art or think we can strive for a higher standard of living across the board, then i cant help you.",
    "I meant the nail artist, not Chappell.",
    "Yess. That's what makes it a good ass speech. She made it relevant to the situation and made her points clear.",
    "Except it was generalities. She wants healthcare from somebody who isn't her employer(by design). She didn't go into MFA, so....?",
    "Then you engage the system to actually do you good. Asking label leadership on an stage isn't gonna do shit. They know what they're doing. They do not care. Rally your fellow artists to push for labor reform through collective bargaining. Everything else is theater. There's unions that don't earn their keep. UFCW is pretty infamous for this. Usually through disengagement of membership -- either through high turnovers or encouraging a \"fuck you, got mine\" culture. It still becomes a question of artist led collective bargaining. The execs are comfortable being the bad guys and the fellow big name artist are let off the hook because it's not their fault, they're not the bad guys. The system festers like it has for decades. What specifically does she even want? Label provided coverage wouldn't have addressed the gap she and many other artists faced. Does she want severance built into contracts? It harder to drop artists? Catastrophe insurance? Longer windows of non productivity if they get insurance through SAG? A union that actually meaningfully represents the fairly unique needs and aspects of the music industry (which are not reflective of the radio ecosystem from 80 years ago)?",
    "Not even her stylist; one of her stylist's assistants.",
    "It feels kinda disingenuous to phrase something that happened a year ago like that",
    "Its going to take port strikes level of protest to get any of this moving. Like to where the artists and I mean big names and people in droves to protest the labels for them to consider it. The port strikes struck fear that if they didnt get paid, aint nobody getting goods or money. The reason I say this is that if the Luigi mangione situation jump started the conversation.it fizzled out quickly despite sending the message.",

    "She just watched an artist she dropped win bna. And A&Rs get points on records(usually 1%). Chapelle has done already sonething like 12 million in revenue, so yeah thats 100k down the drain. More. Im sure shes very salty (though if her first name is emily, she's probably not that salty)",
    "Didnt she say *I* felt used? It felt more like whining about how hard she had it becoming a world famous, pop star not about blue collar workers paying for treatment. And, once again, Ive been in the same boat as her. Ive paid for my health insurance because the pay I was getting made being an independent contractor more lucrative. I also had medications to take that cost an arm and leg out of pocket. But I knew Id made my choice so I wasnt whining on social media about how I felt used by the construction company I worked for didnt pay me super high wages **and** free insurance. Why is she held to different standard?",
    "And thats wrong. The working people of the world arent put her to subsidize fucking art majors with their tax money. Do you not see how this causes resentment among the unlucky Americans? The ones who dont have the time luxury or opportunity to pursue their dreams? Were supposed to stay behind and be the runway for the *artists* of the world to take off on? Somebody gotta scrub the toilets. Also, I disagree. No govt healthcare plan should be used to help people trying to make it big in the music or entertainment industry.",
    "fun fact: in brazil it's free for foreigners too, which is very useful, especially around the holiday season, due to the heat/potential food related issues",
    "Because the world isnt your piggy bank. The majority of Americans who make the hard but necessary choice to join the workforce and pay their taxes shouldnt have to subsidize free insurance for the people that just want to work in low paying, low benefit jobs like the arts. Its the people who *choose* to work in that industry who bear the cost and responsibility for handling their healthcare. Same as the blue collar workers or low wage workers.",
    "Yes she would lol And shed have wait lists. Oh actually no she wouldnt cause shes a rich celebrity so theyd probably skip her to the front of the line. Im sure youd say that was fair too right?",
    "Is she paying for her teams insurance? Im sure she got assistants and makeup artists and stylists. Maybe she should put her money where her mouth is?",
    "I dont remember her name and I need to find out lol",
    "\"I told myself if I ever won a Grammy and I got to stand up here in front of the most powerful people in music, I would demand that labels and the industry profiting millions of dollars off of artists would offer a livable wage, and healthcare especially, to developing artists\" \"It was so devastating to feel so committed to my art and feel so betrayed by the system and so dehumanized to not have help.\" \"Labels, we got you, but do you got us?\" Maybe you should be whinging about it on social media? That's how change happens? By having these conversations and saying actually no this isn't fair.",
    "As if people trying to make it big dont usually have another job (or jobs) to stay afloat, usually in the service industry where they arent covered by insurance either.",
    "Big artists like Halsey and Chapell Roan also pay taxes. Small indie artists who havent made it also have to pay taxes. Everyone (aside from like corporate billionaire ceos apparently) has to pay taxes. Nobody is subsidizing anybody else.",
    "No actually we are there to subsizide fucking art majors. Guess what we listen to on the way to our jobs: fucking art majors, guess what's on the radio playing over the supermarket speakers for those shopping or working? ... fucking art majors. Creative people pursuing their dreams and making music, movies, tv shows, books etc! They are making things that entertain us and they deserve to have healthcare and feel safe and supported to express themselves into their art so we can enjoy it? Helping people pay for a blood test or medication is not \"helping people make it big in the industry\", it's being a decent human being.",
    "I'm on paid annual leave from my job in a country that gives me 4 weeks paid annual leave and 10 days paid sick leave by law per year... so I've got all day to reply to your comments, but you aren't replying to me... did i say something to upset your fractured idea of the american dream?  Edit just to rub it in: I've got a four day weekend cos we had a public holiday yesterday, which is a paid day off for everyone scenario. If you happen to work on a public holiday here, you get time and a half and a day in lieu (day off to take at a later day).",

    "Youre saying an entertainer like Halsey contributes more to society so she deserves more in terms of pay then, say, a nurse?",
    "The truth is, your amount of paid leave is also common in the US, but it's tied to your job and not the government. You can have a great job with great benefits, even unlimited paid/sick leave (Not that it works out to be a real benefit. Many people end up taking less time off if it's \"unlimited\"). But there are also people who work just as hard in jobs that don't provide any benefits because they're contractors or have multiple part-time jobs. This inequality is built into the system when you make benefits contingent on employment. It also makes it harder to leave your job or even attempt to be an entrepreneur or artist. It's built to keep you in the rat race and fighting for scraps like the comment you're replying to.",
    "He is lost yea.",
    "I said nothing about how much pay someone deserves and who deserves what over one particular person or which contribution to society is \"more worthy\" of healthcare. But while we are here, they both deserve it equally.... one may pay more tax than the other, but it all goes into the same pot. My tax covers healthcare.. I haven't needed to go to a doctor or use health services this year... it's not like I'm demanding the government give me my money back.... it goes into a healthcare budget which the goverment allocates to hospitals etc to help people who are sick and need those services now and then if in the future I need those services my care is covered from the same pot.",
    "Im a nurse in Canada where my tax dollars subsidize everyones healthcare. Artists, college kids, stay at home parents, homeless people on the streets. I will gladly pay that every time because all humans deserve healthcare. The amount I pay into taxes for free healthcare is not the main thing keeping me from achieving Halseys level of income lol",
    "No one's saying she deserves more pay than a nurse, but the art she creates makes a ton of money for the record labels she works for. Do you think the record labels should just steal all the money and leave her with less than a nurse because \"That's all she deserves\"? Why does the record label deserve more than a nurse? Nurses deserve way more pay but people who do work that creates lots of money will always earn more because that's the nature of money",
    "Yeah, and that's really shitty. It shouldn't depend on if you get a good boss or not. A lot of places here offer extra leave too, including where I work. But yeah that's the minimum required by law for a full time worker. We have alot of contractors too but they are still covered by our health system. They need to make sure that what they're getting paid covers allowing for holidays, taxes, etc. and contracting is predominately used by professionals in either trades or the govt. So big enough money, not a struggling musician. The system in my country is by no means perfect but it certainly doesn't feel as rigged and warped as the American system (yet, the rot is spreading - we've got a dropkick coalition of chaos atm ourselves)",
