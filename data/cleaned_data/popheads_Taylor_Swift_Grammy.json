    "Ok now what about all the gay porn that people managed to somehow scrobble",
    "I talked a lot about the overall stats in [yesterday's thread]( so I won't repeat them here, but I will give you...

Also congratulations to Jay Park for having the honour of recieving the most points with only 1 charting song ~~despite most people hating your part of the song~~ --- I want to give a special shoutout to the songs that received exactly one total point. This means that they placed exactly at #50, in exactly one weekly chart, and never appeared again. Since the chart only started in 2017, there are some particularly funny entries to see here. There are also 15 unlucky artists who have only appeared ONCE in the entire charts history, and barely scraped a placement at #50.

    "Amazing how many of the top 100 are from 2024 despite having the least amount of time to chart! I can only presume the sub's growth has something to do with it. Also stoked to see American Teenager here",
    "i love that this is mostly female presenting in the tops spots",
    "Good Luck, Babe! doing that in less than a year ",
    "My lord Chappell!",
    "The only charts I care about are popheads charts, let's goooo. Justice for our girl CRJ tho ",
    "good luck babe the classic that you are!",
    "Can someone give me some Kylie Minogue stats for this? Like has she had a song chart here and if so, does it rank anywhere on the top 100 chart?",
    "okay everyone we just need to keep streaming good luck babe for 63 more weeks we can do it y'all",
    "> Meek Mill I have to wonder if this Dreams and Nightmares pop up has anything to do with the Philadelphia Eagles and their Super Bowl win in 2018. That was their hype song for the post season, ran out to it at the Super Bowl and was pretty synonymous with the team that year. I cant think of any other bump but weve been doing this for 400 weeks so who knows!",
    "Justice for Ecco2k",
    "I went to go check just for you, Padam Padam is Kylie's highest song at #109 with 612 points. Tension is the next closest all the way down at #453 with 273 points.",
    "This flop ho, all my Padam payola and not even a top 100 placement.",
    "1 Taylor Swift 2 Drake 3 SEVENTEEN 4 Billie Eilish 5 Stray Kids 6 Zach Bryan 7 The Weeknd 8 Eminem 9 Kendrick Lamar 10 Sabrina Carpenter",
    "I didn't expect to see Zach Bryan on the list. With the likelihood of no new album and only re-releases this year, I wonder if Taylor can secure the #1 spot next year. Since BTS is coming back soon and Drake dropped a new album, I feel like the competition will be good!",
    "I have never heard of seventeen or stray kids. Are they k pop??",
    "TTPD being her first #1 on the global album sales chart is crazy omg  she's finally beaten the #2 curse after like 5 of her albums getting 'stuck' there, I think releasing it in the first 6 months of the year was what made it happen",
    "The Torture poets departament achieves an all kill in IFPI global charts: 1.Streaming Albums 1.Pure Sales albums (5.6 M pure sales) 1.Vinyl Sales Albums (2.2 M vinyl) Taylor achieves multiple entries in global streaming chart (#1 TTPD, #7 Lover, #12 Midnights #16 1989 TV) and Vinyl sales album chart (#1 TTPD, #5 1989 TV, #6 Midnights #7 folklore #9 lover #11 Evermore).",
    "There was just a thread created yesterday saying Taylors music is consumed by only white girls. Haha The Tortured poets department opened with 100M streams in China alone in one week. Also, Taylor Swift was the only female as well as non Chinese artist in top 10 of China last year and she was 2nd. And as an international fan of Taylor, I think USA is actually the only place where she has competition cause globally, those in USA with cultural impacts or GP lovers are all khias Indian guy here.",
    "Taylor, even without smash single from TTPD, 18m units in the US alone, no one comes close.",
    "and haters still say only Taylor's fan listen to her. NO, Swifties only can't achieve #1 on GLOBAL, STREAMING, SALES and VINYL all at once. this proves the gp LISTENS to Taylor Swift.",
    "Congrats to Taylor!",
    "Well, thank God its her and not Drake.",
    "Surprisingly, not many kpop acts this year. Last year the top 10 of the sales chart was entirely kpop (with the exception of Taylor Swift). I wonder whether the sales dropped or the calculation methodology changed?",
    "Kpop boy groups sales go crazy",
    "Drake at #2 is insane",
    "Not too surprising a list but I wouldve assumed Beyonc would at least crack the top 10, *Cowboy Carter* had a big debut but I guess not much staying power.",
    "Oh wow Zach Bryan is on the top 10 list",
    "I think if rep and debut both get released this year, and specially if reputation delivers on the unfathomable level of hype, plus the steam The anthology still has left in the tank, she can get it. However BTS has a ton of potential with their comeback if the music hits with the gp like dynamite/butter, it's gonna be absolutely massive. I feel like all of them got bigger with their solo releases so the potential as group is higher than before the break.",
    "I'm pretty sure she will release a new album this year and i think it will be before the re-recordings",
    "I'm pretty sure she will release a new album this year and i think it will be before the re-recordings",
    "If anyone from the country genre was going to make the list I thought it wouldve been Morgan Wallen. I think Taylor gets it next year as well. With Taylor its irrelevant if its re-records, Rep TV is going to be huge, and Debut TV will do well and I think she may put another album out near the end of the year now that Eras has wrapped and she has the time. Theres lot of good artists currently so who knows, but itll be entertaining.",
    "Yes, they are both kpop groups.",
    "In 2023 they were 2nd and 3rd on that same chart, so they've gone down a bit compared to the previous year (not a mystery as to why, their physical album sales have gone down pretty significantly compared to the previous year).",
    "That only happened because she always released late in the year like October or November, so her new project was only accumulating sales for 2 months compared to the 5 or 6 months that other projects had",
    "and you'd still hear bullshit about torchie being only heard in people's echo chamber when it's both streaming and selling well",
    "Taylor's legendary status is assured. She is already in the same league with Michael Jackson, The Beatles, Elvis, Madonna.",
    "Wait, TTPD topped album sales, not Seventeen? Or that 5.6 from TTPD alone? Based on BB or luminate she sold 6M pure in US alone for the whole catalogs.",
    "Lol this reminds me of an American i saw on tiktok. They were upset that on rednote none of the Chinese people they were talking too cared about kpop music, they only wanted to talk about taylor  not sure why they thought Chinese people would be big kpop stans, they must have gotten lost on Google maps.",
    "Actually, Taylor has serious local competition in most music markets, but she's one of the very few artists to be successful almost everywhere.",
    "I hope her next project will be more radio friendly aka real pop bangers like 1989 or Red.",
    "Kpop saw a decline in album sales last year. ([Source](",
    "I think you might be misremembering, there were four kpop artists in 2023's top ten. There are two that have dropped out, NewJeans and TXT. NewJeans are currently embroiled in legal issues with their company which might explain why they aren't in the top ten this year. TXT I don't know well enough to comment on why that might be.",
    "Let's not exaggerate too much, There were four kpop acts last year in the top 10 (Seventeen, Stray Kids, TXT, NewJeans). The chart that's trusted by kpop is the one for physical sales, whereas the global artist chart takes streaming into account, which means kpop acts need a lot more sales to take spots from Western artists. Kpop album sales did decline a bit compared to 2023, which has led to Seventeen and Stray Kids to go down a bit, and TXT to fall out of the top 10. (NewJeans only released a few singles, and lost a lot of their momentum, so they're likely much more far down for 2024).",
    "Agree! I dont know anyone who listens to him so his achievements always come as a surprise to me somehow. But then again, Ive heard some comments from others about almost all pther artists on this list so I guess crowds are different :D",
    "When you consider drake is a pop star and not a rapper it makes sense",
    "Cowboy Carter is #18 on the albums chart so it's not too surprising. Beyonce made the top 20 at #18 too. This is the rest of the list btw: 11 Ariana Grande 12 Post Malone 13 Morgan Wallen 14 ENHYPEN 15 Travis Scott 16 Kanye West 17 Lana Del Rey 18 Beyonc 19 Linkin Park 20 Bad Bunny I am surprised that Bad Bunny is \"this low\".",
    "It wasnt as big as it was made to be. It only sat at number 1 on Billboard for 2 weeks and sold only around half a million copies. Taylor had 17 weeks at number quandary sold 6.2 million copies. Taylor outsold and out streamed the 5 artists behind her combined according to the IFPI data.",
    "Yeah, BTS' return is highly anticipated. Kpop album sales are expected to increase because of their return. It depends what they have in store! I know they're releasing a 10 year anniversary project, but no clue if there's going to be an album later this year or next. However, there's still a lot of excitement for Reputation TV and that excitement could possibly help Taylor keep that top spot.",
    "She tends to follow a two year schedule. She's basically been doing this since the start of her career. The biggest gap was between 1989 and Reputation (3 years); however, since then she returned to basically releasing a new album every two years (Midnights in 2022 and TTPD last year). So, I'm expecting Debut and Rep TV this year and new album next year.",
    "Seventeen sold 3.4M and they were 2nd. Funny thing is, nobody from US like Billie or Sabrina was even in top 20.",
    "The expectation of them being kpop stans is likely because a pretty big chunk of kpop album sales is due to Chinese stans mass buying them.",
    "Thats what I was trying to say that overall, she leads. Like in terms of Vinyl sales, there wasnt any Asian in top 15. And in terms of album units sales, there wasnt any non Asian in top 20 except Taylor. She is an all rounder. And I hate it so much how people say she is local. Like I would like to see ur favs be all rounder like her.",
    "I feel like there was so much single potential on TTPD but she insists on picking the worst single choices every damn time ",
    "The of means Taylor overall, she sold 18 M in US in 2024 confirmed by Billboard, second biggest year ever after her own 2023 with 18.5 M",
    "My bad, i mean 18m for her whole catalogue in the US.",
    "Very interesting, but i disagree about the HYBE/ador dispute being a factor, i think it only really affected newjeans. But it's right about 2025 being a indicator as bts is undoubtedly the juggernaut of kpop, and blackpink has a lot of demand after their hiatus and solos. (Then again, it's very hard to say if this affects other groups)",
    "I think even without the dispute, there still would've been less Kpop acts within the top ten. NewJeans' Japan debut underperformed. It looks like TxT had two comebacks, but I think general fatigue led to sales decline. I think Kpop will rise again with the return of BTS. I dunno if BlackPink is releasing a new album, but their return should also help.",
    "My bad, i was in fact thinking about the sales chart, i will edit it",
    "It's weird to see people act like Drake isn't huge because he is at a (deserved) low right now. Drake pulls in massive numbers.",
    "Most artist most streamed music are the old catalog classic albums/songs not the new shxt",
    "Wikipedia article is very outdated. Drake comes in second, Taylor is over 200M in sales and Drake has 170M, Taylor hasnt bothered updating her certifications in 4 years, Id she did shed be at 20+ diamond certifications. Taylor is also ahead of Drake in total streams by roughly 1 billion streams. Drake still doing way better than everyone else though, Kendrick\\`s metrics are not even on Drake\\`s radar, just like Beyoncs are not near Taylors. Thats why the Grammys can no longer be respected. They purposely awarded Bey and Kendrick this year to try and bring the top 2 artists of at least the last 15 years down a peg.",
    "Can't he be both?",
    "Damn Kanye was more popular than Beyonc in 2024? That might be the most shocking part of this list.",
    "Bad Bunny being that low is a complete joke. Its pretty much entirely because his biggest audience is Spanish speakers. Which is ironic because, as a white Scottish person, hes even big here.",
    "That doesnt mean it wasnt big, just means Taylor was monumentally bigger. Like *TTPD* was breaking sales records left and right so that cant be the barometer of success.",
    "Im really curious to see what BTS comes back with tbh. Especially with each members solos being pretty different sonically I wonder what its going to sound like. I am not so familiar with their album creation process except for RM is heavily involved so I wonder if it means its already been written pre - enlistment or in progress at the moment . I feel like if an album comes it will be more like fall 2025 but I could be wrong . Also super interested to see what their eventual tour is going to look like apart from massive.",
    "I think Rep TV has the potential for a much wider audience this time after the Eras tour. Shes massively more popular than she was in 2017 when Rep originally came out and she was had just returned from her self imposed exile and the failed cancellation. Rep TV is going to do big numbers.",
    "Well to me all signs are leading to a new album but we will see ",
    "One thing you need to know about Taylor is to not follow patterns. Now is pretty obvious that TS12 is coming before the last two tvs",
    "After hours is not at all in top 20. You may mistaken with Golden Hour by Ateez.",
    "Very few Asian artists ever release vinyls tbh. Probably because of the delay to get them pressed, it doesn't fit with the faster pace of local industries.",
    "At least Taylor previously picked the right song as the first single (Anti-Hero). If you think about it, Taylor didn't promote TTPD as much as she could. Barely any TV appearances (if any), barely any interviews, no late night show performances, one music video, only 2 singles, etc.",
    "I agree, I don't think the HYBE vs. MHJ dispute really caused that much of an issue with Kpop as a whole. I know I'm an ARMY so maybe my opinion is biased, but I honestly think the lack of BTS is really what caused the sales to decline.",
    "BlackPink is supposedly releasing new music as a group this year! Personally cannot wait. But yes, heavyweights coming back, I'm so intrigued to see where BTS will be on this list next year.",
    "Not in the case of Taylor or Drake though, their new stuff outsells/out streams everyone else as well as their old catalogue. Tortured poets outsold and out streamed the 5 artists behind her combined in the IFPI global data.",
    "Didn't he have the most streamed rap album for 2024 with a 2023 album?",
    "I think Kendrick and Beyonce just made really good music this year. It's not a conspiracy. There's certainly industry politics but it's not like there's a movement to bring down Taylor or Drake. (Well, people definitely hate Drake right now but unless proof of the rumored crimes materializes it's not going to go anywhere)",
    "Beyonces catalogue is inexistent, Numbers are terrible right and left. Its weird because songs like single ladies do very low numbers.",
    "Keeping her first streaming-era album off of streaming for years was a huge loss. Songs from Lemonade wouldve been on playlists and being replayed to this date, but she torpedoed its longevity by restricting it for so long. It still gets significantly less streams per day than every other album of hers",
    "Bad bunny did pretty well considering he didn't release an album in 2024, but he's off to an excellent start this year",
    "Well it actually does, artists make music for public and fan consumption. The streaming and sales of TTPD indicates millions of people wanted to listen to it which is the ultimate success. The records and awards are only a byproduct of that success. The metrics of Cowboy Carter indicate it was not hugely consumed by her fan base or the general public regardless of the massive media push for it, hype and radio airplay. Beyonc made this album to prove a point but ultimately it was not what her fan base liked, Taylor is primarily a storyteller and lyricist focusing on her life experiences and thats what TTPD gave the fans.",
    "I'm super curious and excited about what they'll come back with! I kinda hope it's more like Run BTS and less like Dynamite (no offense to dynamite since I really enjoyed that song). There is a 10-year HYYH anniversary project that is coming out sometime this year. I imagine it'll be like Proof with a few new songs and demos. As far as their involvement, all the members are involved but the rap line I would say are the most involved with the album creation process. So I'm expecting a lot of involvement from the three of them again.",
    "I just made this comment, but this schedule is what is leading me to believe that the re-records are this year with a new album next year: * 2021 = Fearless and Red TV * 2022 = Midnights * 2023 = Speak Now and 1989 TV * 2024 = TTPD Again, I could be wrong but I think it's very fair to think she'll follow this schedule -- especially if she wants to take this year easier following the end of the eras tour and as she preps to direct the film she wrote.",
    "Teach me your ways... What are the signs?",
    "I personally don't think TS12 is coming before the re-records. She's been on a consistent pattern within the last few years. * 2021 = Fearless and Red TV * 2022 = Midnights * 2023 = Speak Now and 1989 TV * 2024 = TTPD So, I feel like it's fair to assume that Rep and Debut will be out this year and a new album next year. Of course things can change, but I'm inclined to believe she's following this schedule.",
    "I dont know what ur talking about. When did I say After Hours. :/",
    "Maybe. But again, even in streams, western leads where Taylor clears again. So, Taylor is an all rounder despite West: streams, vinyls East: album units",
    "She was this close  to burning from overexposure last year(s), with the eras tour success, the breakup, matty healy drama, dating Travis, winning AOTY for Midnights, the NFL appearances, the stan wars with Billie's/Charli's/Chapell's fans, the criticism for flying so much, endorsing Kamala in the elections, etc. Taylor was everywhere. I'm not surprised she didn't see the need to promote TTPD, or maybe outright avoided it.",
    "Their music is not for me (I tried) but I think their return will be huge - especially with Ros's collaboration with Bruno. It might've brought new fans? I am really excited for BTS' return! There's a 10-year anniversary project for HYYH coming out this year (hopefully in April) and they might kick off a tour at the end of the year. It'll be an exciting year!",
    "That was future we dont trust you if you look at his highest charting album right now its take care",
    "Thats crazy to me, in my mind she always had one of the strongest back catalogues for both singles and albums.",
    "Im not questioning the success of *TTPD* Im just saying that since its the most successful album of the year its not obviously not the standard.",
    "I would be very surprised if their comeback is anything like Dynamite/Butter/Permission to Dance! Yet to Come/Run BTS/For Youth is very in-line sound-wise with the rest of their discography and the English trio songs are kind of their own thing. I'm personally hoping for a *BE* level of involvement from the members, that is involved on every level, not just the lyrics/production but the MV, etc. ",
    "You will see ",
    "I was just commenting on Asian artists' absence on the Vinyl chart, not questioning Taylor's dominance.",
    "BTS aren't my cup of tea (although Mic Drop is a banger I'll never stop listening to) but I will for sure be tuning in for their return. And happy for their fans after their long wait! Gonna need tips for when my faves start their military service. :(",
    "Maybe I am wrong, but I thought for all the dogs was highest streamed rap album and in the top 5/10 for all genres",
    "The English trio really had a positive response from the GP. So I can see a scenario where they maybe one more English radio friendly song when they comeback. But hopefully I'm wrong. >I'm personally hoping for a *BE* level of involvement from the members, that is involved on every level, not just the lyrics/production but the MV, etc. This would be cool! I would honestly love to see JK design an album cover, Jin to handle merch/promotional ideas, Tae create concepts for videos, and etc.",
    "Im on your side hopeful-pickle! I think shes saving the TVs for a rainy day. I think ts12 comes in May soonest.",
    "Who are your faves? Ugh, military enlistment sucks so much. Although, I'll say that it wasn't so bad with BTS because they had so many solo releases that it made time flyby. And the members periodically came online which was really nice. I think BTS handled their enlistment exceptionally well and more Kpop agencies might follow what BigHit did which should hopefully be reassuring. It's still sucks though and it's sad. So, don't feel embarrassed about feeling sad or emotional when your faves do enlist.",
    ">So I can see a scenario where they maybe one more English radio friendly song when they comeback. Honestly I got the impression they're kind of over chasing that specific kind of success - maybe I'm just projecting or reading too into it, but yeah. I'm not too worried since there would still be the B-sides, etc. >JK design an album cover, Jin to handle merch/promotional ideas, Tae create concepts for videos Your words to Big Hit's ears lmao, I would go crazy if that happened!",
    "I agree that, from what I saw, their enlistment period has been handled very well and I hope to see other companies follow suit! Stray Kids for me. A little different because they have two Aussies who don't have to serve and I'm excited to see what the two of them end up doing while the others are away. But the closer it gets the more I'm dreading how it won't be the same for a while. Thanks for your nice comment!",
    "Is SKZ going to start their enlistment after their tour this year? Well, the two Australian members will definitely fill the void with solo projects. The group will also probably latter their enlistment, like what BTS did, so there might be other solo projects or subgroup projects as the members go. And again the members can post online! It just depends on their personal choice. Like, Suga opted to not post since he's doing social service. JungKook shook the fandom when he did a WeVerse live last year. Jin posted on social media once a month, but he also pre-recorded some videos for fans. So, it won't be totally silent from SKZ! It'll just be different.",
    "The oldest non-Aussie is 27 this year so it's coming. The tour is part of why I'm thinking about it already because I wonder, after being spoiled by years of multiple releases, how much group music we'll get while they're on tour and then I do expect them to start enlisting next year. I guess not hearing from them made when they are able to interact that much more exciting and special.",

    "Thanks for the incredible All Stars KingHan and beeo! There's never any escape from the mess of All Stars results (speaking from experience) and you both did an amazing job running and organizing the rate! Sorry the stats are so late - it's 2i in the morning here so apologies if anything is off with the text or stats were missed! [Leaderboard]( and [songlist]( updates! #**Songs** Congratulations to Stevie Wonder, 3-time rate winner for getting yet another win! Though it's **Sir Duke's** third rate appearance it finally managed to pull it off this time! No 9+ scores, but we'll do the winner as usual! * 773rd: Grimes (ft. Janelle Mone) - Venus Fly (8.810) * **774th: Stevie Wonder - Sir Duke (8.809)** * 775th: Mitski - Love Me More (8.808) **Stats** * The controversy kings make their return as **#SELFIE** becomes the 6th most controversial song rated on the sub! The Chainsmokers hold nearly a third of the top 10 most controversial as #SELFIE joins Closer [AS4 - #3] and Closer [2016 EP Rate - #9]. * **Think U The Shit** also joins #SELFIE as it becomes the 41st most controversial song we've rated. The two new additions knock two 2009 classics off the list: Kesha - Dinosaur and Owl City - Fireflies * **#SELFIE** also gets on the list for 'most 0'd songs' as 14 is the cutoff (which it got). It sits in a tie for 41st with numerous other tracks including fellow All Stars honouree stupid horse (AS4) * This is our 5th time rating **Taylor Swift - Blank Space**, tieing it as one of our many 3rd most rated songs. Other 5 timers include California Gurls, Call Me Maybe, Rather Be, Shake It Off, Tik Tok, and Viva La Vida * A few other songs get their 4th appearance this rate including **Disturbia**, **Latch**, **2 On**, **Sunflower**, and **Diva** (in descending order of their average score across each of their appearances) #**Artists** I'm working on limited hardware at 2 in the morning so I very much considered not doing this section, but it's not an All Stars without a focus on the stars **Artist Shifts** Possibly a first for an All Stars rate we actually don't have any new additions to the leaderboard - only shifts! As such there won't be any major highlights but I'll update placement changes below. As these are only single songs (often for artists with at least 30-50 already rated) they may not do too much. Though there are exceptions...

And to think a year ago today we were still making 'Stevie Wonder no rate win' jokes * **Stevie** also manages to swap spots with Jessie Ware and takes a spot in the top 10 highest rated artists on the sub at #10! * We also have another swap further down the list as **OutKast** take the boundary spot at #50 from **Tina Turner**, whose drop of only a few points wasn't enough to keep her in the top 50. * Though there's a bit of movement at the bottom of the chart, **Post Malone** finally manages to scavenge up enough points to escape the bottom 50 rated artists on the sub! He's at 52 so while he's not out of the clear yet, it's a start at a new life. Joining the bottom 50 in his place is none other than fellow AS8 artist **Ice Spice**, whose appearance in the rate dropped her over 40 places into the 49th lowest average score on the sub * **Ice Spice** also gets an appearance on the most controversial artists list as she ends up as our 9th highest average artist controversy. The Chainsmokers hold 1st for this stat and their appearance here only helps extend their lead * Thanks to a single lone 11, **Hall & Oates** manage to escape the no 11's list with their very first 11 this rate. Though their names will be noted on the historic list for shameful perpetuity, at least they don't have an active streak going * **GloRilla** and **ScHoolboy Q** manage to both hold onto their no 0's streak for another song. We'll see if that lasts into Cali Rap in April * **Beyonc** joins **The Weeknd** in the top spot for most rate appearances as she picks up her 29th here to tie him. Rihanna, Taylor, and Ariana follow in 3rd with 27 each * There's no major shifts on the most artist 11's leaderboard, but we did hit a milestone as **Taylor Swift** picked up her 500th 11 this rate! * There is something for the most artist 0s chart however, as The Chainsmokers get enough to become the 10th most 0'd artist on the sub. They are the only artist in the top 10 with fewer than 80 songs rated (they have 17). Their 0s/per song rate is 6.059 where the next highest in the top 10 is only 2.534 (Taylor Swift) #**Rate** * With 74.19% of the rate getting at least someone's 11, **AS8** becomes the rate with the 17th highest 11 spread across songs! Other fellow All Stars rates are also on this list include AS1 [12th] and AS4 [25th] * With an even 82% of the participants handing out a 0, **All Stars 8** becomes the rate with the 15th highest 0 usage on the sub! AS6 [10th - 84.31%] and AS4 [25th - 78.91%] are also on this list",
    "# SONGENIALITY RESULTS Many were taken aback by the cruelty of the day 1 and 2 results, so we asked you **which songs were most robbed** to settle it once and for all. We received 71 votes!  In first place, with 17 votes, was **Rainbow Connection**  In second place, with 11 votes each, were **Wanna Be** and **Piano Man**  In third place, with 9 votes each, was a 4-way tie between **Lazerpop, Blank Space, Latch**, and **212**  Only four songs did not receive votes: **Find Your Way Back**, **'Cross The Room**, **34+35**, and **Think U The Shit (Fart)** # RATE VILLAIN We also asked you to vote for the **rate villain**, the song that least deserved to be in day 3. 66 people weighed in. 14 votes decreed this as **HOT TO GO!** This was despite Chappell receiving the highest number of artist votes (and the second highest number of overall votes for this song) during the wildcard process. In second place, with 7 votes, was **It's A Sin**. # WORST DAY 66 voters responded to our question on which day was worse, and 63% of you decreed that **day 2 was worse**. # LOTR SHOWDOWN Finally, your favourite LoTR character was a fierce fight, but **Gandalf** narrowly won out with 18% of the 61 responses. 16.4% voted for Gollum, and 11.5% for Aragorn. Other notable responses included 'the Black Eyed Peas' (raising questions about how much more Fergalicious the Fellowship could have been), Eowyn (who I should definitely have included in the original poll), and 'I don't do that nerd shit' (host note: this user plays Fire Emblem).

This is Parents Cleaning On A Sunday music. The pre and post choruses are perfect. The horns and drums especially. I like how the drums sound kinda jazzy as well **Frajer** (10): best song about the joy of music not sung by Madonna **frogaranaman** (10): this is one of those songs you hear the first note of and just think, \"oh yeah this is objectively perfect\" **NervousLemon6670** (10): Stevie Wonder certified ender of popheads misandry that you are **NFLfreak98** (10): Im still of the opinion that the whistle doesnt really work in this song, it sounds way too cheap. But the rest of the song is so killer that its still a 10 **Roxieloxie** (10): the best song ever made and i will cry when it goes out in 7th place with an 8.784 average **sarcasticsobs** (10): Goodness gracious **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): addison rae continues to be a culture vulture by stealing stevie wonders iconic ode to music for her whitewashed music is so good series of tweets **Verboten\\_Prince** (10): I love music oh my god **wathombe** (10): this can't be anything but a 10 **welcome2thejam** (10): This song was made for me & the homies to do a carefree choreographed dance throughout a city park **Ayzrules** (9.3): this is so groovy! **jman457** (9.2): Stevie Wonder the icon you are! **daftsone** (9): Stevie Wonder firing on all cylinders, one of his absolute best **qazz23** (9): of course this is good, strong hook and amazing sax **lexiaredery** (8.5): This is a little too cheesy for me but then it's Stevie Wonder so it's basically impossible to not love **team\\_kockroach** (8.5): The lyrics are a little too light, but the composition of this song is a real beautiful one. **camerinian** (8): it's a nice song that'll make a thoroughly boring winner, jon batiste ass pleasant pick for #1 **ConnerY2323** (8): you can feel it ALL over? im afraid the disease is spreading. theres nothing we can do. **Runaway3212** (8): this is objectively a great song but its too overplayed for me **Stryxen** (8): this random old man ate **WindysaStarStarStar** (8): who **icantlikeeveryone** (7): The meaning of this song is good, and saxophone is super amazing. ## certified music haters **IIIHenryIII** (6.5): too happy for my taste **Nagisoid** (6): I'm in the business of misery **Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Have soured on this one with time, it feels very elementary school band recital. **Poydoo** (5.5): was never too moved by this **TiltControls** (4): Oh I Wish the legend you could've been... This is about the 3rd time we've rated this now and I feel bad every time cause this is like one of the very few Stevie tracks I don't care for in the slightest. Though the remix is a nice escape **ricki** (3): each time we rate this song it makes me feel like the grinch **RandomHypnotica** (1): i do not subscribe to the stevie hype I fear... unless it's Superstition",
    "Honestly for as bad as the elims have been I feel like this is a solid Day 3... I've been wrong about every song that I thought was a contender though so I'm not gonna bother predicting a winner.",

(Shes from Oklahoma but whatever) **camerinian** (9): genuinely quite sad that the current country music moment would fucking hate a song like this **Ghost-Quartet** (9): Classic song with great vocals from Reba but something I don't think people appreciate enough about the song in this day and age is what a statement it made when Bobbie Gentry originally released it in 1969... it touches on topics like poverty, welfare, sex work, which are still pretty taboo even today. I'd give it a 10 but Reba did a live version with Kelly Clarkson that kinda washed the recorded version for me. **lexiaredery** (9): We need more country rates because this is basically my only exposure to it and I miss it **Ayzrules** (8.5): this has a really nice melody! **icantlikeeveryone** (8.5): Wow.... I don't like country genre for 97% of the time, and this song didn't singlehandedly change my opinion, but she sounds very fabulous here, and I really like the melodies, it's so colorful! **emayzee** (8.2): honestly modern country has really warped my view of the genre bc the old stuff can be GOOD **slimboyfriend** (8.2): me in the billboard top songs of 2014 when I gave fancy an 8 **apatel27** (8): American dream in a nutshell **FitzMarble** (8): that one coworker who randomly trauma dumps after a few days of working with them and you cant escape **implasdad** (8): good solid country music **PrimaryCrusaders** (8): I wish all modern country songs could go as hard as this one **ricki** (8): im sorry this happened to fancy but at least we got this song form it **Runaway3212** (8): Im happy All Stars gives you another chance at some songs cause this song has grown on me a lot **seanderlust** (8): This is kind of Jukebox Hero-coded no I will not be explaining **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i lied to my mom that reba was a converted muslim so i could buy the reba full series dvd collection and showed her this album cover as proof **Verboten\\_Prince** (7.3): Who the hell names their daughter Fancy anyways? **Awkward\\_King** (7): im sorry this could've eaten as a lip-sync song fuck the as5 producers for not giving kennedy enough time to learn it (but if youre a texas queen you should already know it by heart kinda) and for not better rigging it for like kylie or ginger **buildingigloos** (7): It reminds me of the country songs that were popular in the 60s, like a story set to music. Also is this the Brooklyn 99 theme tune **frogaranaman** (7): \"I was born white trash\" omg finally a lyric this sub can relate to **mustwinfullgaming** (7): I really liked the verses of this one, but I'm ngl...the chorus let me down sadly. Still a good song though. **pbk** (7): i still don't think this song is mixed well but it's fun **qazz23** (7): good cover, like the bigger sound of the chorus **team\\_kockroach** (7): Maybe it doesnt need to be 5 minutes long, but I love the narrative of this song a lot. **vayyiqra** (7): Never realized the lyrics to this are bleak and about grim stuff like poverty ## let her down **IIIHenryIII** (6): Im a big country music fan myself, but I never got the appeal of this song **innuendo\\_overdose** (5.5): its no the Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, Ill tell you that for free **daftsone** (5): I wasnt let down, just not let up either **RandomHypnotica** (5): the only Reba song i care about is I'm a Survivor **undisclosedthroway** (4): I didnt choose to be this way but I just cannot stand country music **pheromenos** (3): yeah this is very far from my music taste ## why are there so many songs about fancies? and what's on the other side? **sarcasticsobs** (9):   I fancy you,   , Hey I love you (Love ya) **stealthamo** (9): Pretty good for not having Charli XCX on the hook. **welcome2thejam** (8): \"Mama, why is my sister's name Rose?\" \"Because your Pa loved roses\" \"Thanks Mama\" \"No problem Fancy by Iggy Azalea ft. Charli XCX\" **marbIeIily** (7.7): Charli and TWICE wanted her nachos so bad **Poydoo** (7.2): IM SO FANCY **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): she cleared the aussie with ease.. twices still winning the fancy off though! **Nagisoid** (4): FANCYYYYYYYYYY YOUUUUUUUUUUUU",

It's a film about talking guinea pig super spies that is of course live-action with CGI furballs as the heroes, Nick Cage plays a mole, anyway the reason I bring it up is because every five seconds they play \"Boom Boom Pow\" by the Black Eyed Peas and if I ever hear that song again I will be reduced to a gibbering mess. what does that have to do with this song?

Yeah, I know, I'm a bad sapphic or whatever. I do really like that racing synthy trackbed (I'm a sucker for 80s retro) and the chorus is definitely addictively catchy, although I don't think I necessarily see the vision on QUITE why this is so loved. Maybe I need to do the dance to really get it. **beeozan** (2.5): it's so hard to be a fan of chappell roan the pop star and then listen to her music and it sounds like this --- ## Host comment **Ghost-Quartet** (7): This was never my favorite Chappell song so it kinda surprised me when it blew up the way it did, I guess people really just do love a good synchronized dance. ## you can take these 11s hot to go! **BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Man you know youve made it for life when you have a song become a mainstay at live sporting events. Anyway, this song makes my heart soar into the sky. **slimboyfriend** (11): this song came on in an uber on my way to LAX once and now I like get it **WindysaStarStarStar** (11): H O T T O GO, ALL THOSE ZEROES GOT TO GO ## it's fun to stay in the rate but sorry this has got to go **Content\\_Love5312** (10): \"It's a slutty YMCA.\" This is the joke I would make when making the case for Chappell to everybody that I knew when I discovered her at the end of 2023. **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): ethical YMCA **hikk** (10): that fad ymca is OVER post-inauguration **NFLfreak98** (10): gen z/alpha got their version of YMCA, were a proper generation now **TiltControls** (10): rip gay wedding anthem ymca just in time for gay wedding anthem hot to go to rise from its ashes **marbIeIily** (8.6): The Village People performing at Trumps inauguration to kickstart their right-wing grifting because this song gobbled all of YMCAs nachos. **frogaranaman** (1): this has horseshoe theory'd itself back into being the straight YMCA ## baby do you like this beat? oh yes i do **Ambrosia42** (10): why do i want pizza all the sudden **babadork** (10): I tried really hard to convince myself that this score was due to recency bias, but I think I just really love this song **bogo** (10): this after enknee1 is like the clip of that one girl crying while doing a tiktok dance **buildingigloos** (10): I hope she plays hot to go **camerinian** (10): one of these days i really hope chappell snaps and makes one of her shows just one straight hour of hot to go and she spends the rest of the time chastising the audience like an angry gym teacher **darj** (10): **dreamingpastel** (10): I already liked the song enough when I first rated it, but after the year of Chappell Roan, it really shot up my personal TRAFOAMP ranking. **FitzMarble** (10): \\*doing the dance\\* **flava** (10): and when this became a hit, everyone cheered, but when Red Wine Supernova became a hit, everyone cheered a lot harder **Frajer** (10): look was me giving this an eleven solely responsible for her meteoric rise, probably not but it surely didn't hurt **Goorry121** (10): the bridge of this song is one of the best things she has done **IIIHenryIII** (10): you better cool down, though, you aint leaving til 95% of the competition is gone **ImADudeDuh** (10): **impla77** (10): wasn't my preferred chappell pick but still a 10 **implasdad** (10): shes a phenomenon (implas note: I don't think he knows about feminomenom lol) **jirachi** (10):  **pbk** (10): even the general public was gagged and most of them can't even spell **RandomHypnotica** (10): everybody do the dance **ricki** (10): god giveth (turned chappell into a global mega star with multiple hits) but it also taketh away (made this song get so big it prevented super graphic ultra modern girl from being rerated) **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): notice how its always a man who says this song is annoying **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): this is so funny to see having to compete here again lol. **wathombe** (10): nothing but fun **welcome2thejam** (10): Bitch!!! **Ayzrules** (9.8): i love her soft rock vibe **Verboten\\_Prince** (9.8): The gays won last year well like musically **Runaway3212** (9.5): another song that has grown on me a lot **bigbigbee** (9): this hits at karaoke, less so at the club where it's a guaranteed way to get smacked in the face **sarcasticsobs** (9): Finally hearing this song outside just half of the chorus, I see why it blew up **uiscebeathaoir** (9): Whenever I fuck something up, I spell out the word incompetent to myself to the tune of this song **nonchalantthoughts** (8.9): seeing the music video go from 500k to 46 million views is insane; I almost put I wish her the best in her career in her album comment because I was not expecting her to blow up **ignitethephoenix** (8.8): not my favorite by her but a bop nonetheless **Awkward\\_King** (8.5): im kind of a stan of everything chappell does except her music. which is enough for me **jman457** (8.5): Its probs a bottom half song on TRAFOAMP but like that just shows how its one of the best pop albums ever made. **NervousLemon6670** (8.2): idk what it is but something about the song doesn't make it stick to me, like it's good but not stand-out **1998tweety** (8): I'm glad we did this rate before Chappell blew up cause Im sure this song would've snatched the crown. Its good but definitely not the best on the album. **CrimsonROSET** (8): i know that this was the viral hit and i like it but i keep looking at everything else and find that this does end up on the lower end of the album for me **letsallpoo** (8): we need to be honest. the prechorus is kinda weak **mustwinfullgaming** (8): is it a bit overrated? yes...is it still great? yes! **stealthamo** (8): Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl deserved the success that this got. Still good though. **innuendo\\_overdose** (7): one time I danced to this while crossdressing at a Pride disco, but Im still too straight to fully love it **moongenightmares** (7): female conan gray ## baby do you like this beat? ehhh **icantlikeeveryone** (6.5): She's a rising star for sure, but this song didn't grab me that much then and now. **ConnerY2323** (6): the verses have grown on me since this blew up but the chorus has grown off me even more **daftsone** (6): Not really a fan of the chorus all that much, but the verses are a bright spot **qazz23** (6): this is fine, somewhat annoying spelling chorus but like the bridge with the fast vocals **seanderlust** (6): Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl deserves the attention this one is getting but you know. Spelling is fun or w/e **Roxieloxie** (5): Can we trade the success this got and give it to smug **Stryxen** (5): a great song ruined by an unlistenably nasal screechy obnoxious chorus. LOVE chappell. **vayyiqra** (5): No strong thoughts on Chappell I just want the internet to stop turning every single thing she does into a Discourse **indie\\_fan\\_** (3): there's a reason i skipped this rate [2] **kerriekipje** (3): do not buy allie x from shein yall **apatel27** (2): Of all the songs it has to be this one that blows up.

I think where this falls short is its meaning - it makes all these vague allusions to the ocean and some kind of storyline, but doesn't really take them anywhere. I've read a tonne of lyrical exegesis speculating on everything from Greek myth to the ego to climate change and none of them really hit for me. This is a pretty track, but one sort of weirdly devoid of a soul (?) **beeozan** (0): I wrote a bunch about not liking this album at all when indieheads rated it for their ult and it's grown off me even more since. i don't care if she's screeching if the verses have no energy and then the chorus is all anthemic fluff without any kind of \"earned\" buildup to it. those \"hey hey hey\"s are incredibly phoned in. the guitar riff in the chorus sounds so limp and the eventual solo is lame. i'm glad i'm not alone in the 0s section at least --- ## Host comment **RandomHypnotica** (10): music video so skinny it scares me ## DESIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE **asadprofessorplum** (11): Im really living it, laughing it, loving it, doing it, completing it, owning it, sucking it, fucking it, throwing it up, shitting on it. I feel like a winner. **camerinian** (11): the more that time passes, the more that i realise this might be a perfect song, and every time I think about this song I cannot help but marvel at how perfect it is. Carolines vocal runs are jaw-dropping, every melodic line is constructed with the most euphoric release in mind, the entire structure of the song is perfect in how it builds itself up with this glamorous, above-it-all self-image, only to drive a stake through it on the bridge where all the deflection disappears in a cloud of doubt and guilt, the instrumentation that is dreamy and dense at the same time, like it's just so surgically precise with hitting the pleasure centres that all this writing has to be done post-listen because the only words in mind when it's playing are cunt yass mother **mustwinfullgaming** (11): like what an iconic introduction to the album...her vocals really did that **NFLfreak98** (11): ugh her voice is truly otherworldly **1998tweety** (10): me when my friends would come to my animal crossing town during the pandemic **Awkward\\_King** (10): all the little greek mythology tidbits referenced throughout the album (and videos) is so cool i love a motif bitch **bigbigbee** (10): I saw Caroline Polachek wear army pants and flip flops a big bow in her hair. so I bought army pants and flip flops a big bow for my hair. **BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now more than ever.EXTENDED SCREECHING **buildingigloos** (10): Her yodeling at the start of the song feels like home to me, the Charli remix was my most played song of 2023, and the original placed high as well. **Content\\_Love5312** (10): I adore this song and this album. I'm a Caroline Polachek Stan through and through. Love her vocalizations that are like beautiful screeches. **FitzMarble** (10): wee ooo wee ooo **flava** (10): yeah nearly everything about this is pop perfection, close 11 contender **Frajer** (10): Jeff Probst if he served **Ghost-Quartet** (10): When Caroline did an AMA on here ages ago I asked her if she had ever seen [Kate Soper's play *Here Be Sirens*]( because the aesthetic of her \"Ocean Of Tears\" reminded me of it and she didn't answer me but after listening to this I am more convinced than ever that she must've. **IIIHenryIII** (10): she could record a full-length album of just her screams and she would eat **impla77** (10): hurts not giving this 11, lowkey one of my fave songs ever. just starts out SCREAMING and never slows down **jirachi** (10): DESIREEEEEEEEEEEE **jman457** (10): Pop perfection, how did a daft punk rip off beat this **lexiaredery** (10): oh my I had forgotten how much I love this album **Nagisoid** (10): When you remember Manhattan is an island **nonchalantthoughts** (10): my 11 runner-up!

The Boy Is Mine is a pretty standard R&B ballad that Ive never really got the huge praise for and Are You That Somebody is the forward thinking masterpiece that represented one of the genres true greats operating at her absolute peak (and Timbalands there for some reason). Brandy and Monica are also great, believe me, but nothing off either their albums can compare to the flash of truly unique, awe-inspiring, incredible pop music genius that is this song. One of the best songs EVER and if Id known it would be this robbed I would have 11d it the first time around **ConnerY2323** (10): aaliyah x timbaland one of the all time most fruitful collaborations and i try not to think too hard **FitzMarble** (10): While creating the beat for \"Are You That Somebody?\", Timbaland was inspired by the Oompa Loompa song from the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film (1971). **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i mean its her signature hit for a reason! **ImADudeDuh** (10): **innuendo\\_overdose** (10): yknow I always forget that Timbaland is one of the most important dudes in the 90s **Nagisoid** (10): The Baby Queen acclaim was in the room... **Roxieloxie** (10): timeless bop **Runaway3212** (10): a legend **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): people make ripoffs of the boy is mine all the time but no one has ever tried to make a ripoff of this. that is because this song is untouchably perfect and everybody knows it **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): how does this get left off the album but put on the annabelle soundtrack? it can be a ten now for it truly feeling like its all alone in this tuff rate **Ayzrules** (9.2): loving this beat **sarcasticsobs** (9): Timbaland, what were u cookin'? **WindysaStarStarStar** (9): idk read my FLO write up on why I like this **RandomHypnotica** (8): i cannot hear this song without thinking of that AOC edit **vayyiqra** (8): Timbaland was the Dem Jointz of the 2000s. I do not think I need to elaborate. **Content\\_Love5312** (7): RIP **Stryxen** (7): cunty mess ## no, you must've mistaken me for someone else **implasdad** (6.2): its pleasant enough **team\\_kockroach** (5): Man, I really want to like this song more. I think the problem is that Timbaland hadnt come into his own yet - you can hear his signature production style but I dont think its executed that well. **icantlikeeveryone** (4): The beat is fun to listen to, but I think I'm just not Aaliyah's target, as I only like several of her songs (this song is not), what I'm certain is that her vocal was amazing! **jman457** (4): This is boring im sorry, the production feels hollow **TiltControls** (3): I'll be taking the 'AS6 host tanking Aaliyah' role from flava this rate I fear. Aaliyah herself sounds great, but I just don't really like the production that much (sorry Timb) ## waa waa **apatel27** (10): Can't wait for this to go out Day 1 with several hate comments on the baby sample **Frajer** (10): that baby's name Doechii **ignitethephoenix** (9): great song minus that random baby in the background **dreamingpastel** (8.5): The baby noises bring it down a little. **buildingigloos** (8): Why are there baby noises in the background **qazz23** (8): Aaliyah's voice is amazing here, don't care for the baby sounds **welcome2thejam** (8): Two nickels meme but it's about the sound of a child nearly ruining an All Stars 8 song **Ghost-Quartet** (7): Wish they had taken that crying baby out of the studio before pressing record. **jirachi** (7):  **pbk** (7): are the baby noises annoying yes but the lesser of two evils as far as aaliyah songs that could have been in this rate **krusso1105** (6.5): I feel bad rating this so low but the baby noises in the background are awful **stealthamo** (6): It's this low purely due to the baby noises. **asadprofessorplum** (5): These baby noises somebody check the Wayfair wardrobes. **BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): Im so, so sorry, but I still cant with the baby sound effect. **daftsone** (4): This is definitely 90s R&B, but this was a miss for me, not a fan of the baby sounds(?) in the background **hikk** (4): get this damn baby out of the studio!!!",

As such, this sort of swinging vaguely funky bassline was definitely not what I expected - it feels like they have diversified their sound, but I'm still not sure if it's in a direction I love. I did quite enjoy the gospel-choir-esque outro, but I think I was hoping for more of that raw energy from their original albums. --- ## living in the real world **bogo** (11): consider this an apology for submitting festival pop rock **buildingigloos** (11): When this song first came out I enjoyed it but didn't get it. Now I'm an adult, it really hits hard. The production of this song is so good, the choir and bassline at the end is top tier. I love when they perform live and Hayley just destroys it at the end. The live version of this just really showcases Hayleys range, she's an amazing singer and it annoys me that she's often missed off the greatest singers lists. When I saw them on Eras tour, the girls sat behind me talked all the way through the acapella outro and ruined my video. Also does anyone else remember the 1st MV they shot for this? I hope it's finished and released at some point **hikk** (11): rather be more like rather NOT am i right **apatel27** (10): Lifechanging song **asadprofessorplum** (10): So this is me on the verge of death just minutes before I die **Awkward\\_King** (10): maybe this is how aint it fun finally wins a rate,. still into you i'll never forgive you. **BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Dont go cryin to your mama. Cause youre on your way to a third rate loss. **dreamingpastel** (10): This was my 11 runner-up in 2014 Year End. If I had actually given it my 11 (and if my math is correct), then it could've won by a 0.001 difference, and that's the kind of stuff that could keep me up at night. **Frajer** (10): girl you know full well it isn't **frogaranaman** (10): it isn't :( **IIIHenryIII** (10): now we can only cry to ourselves **krusso1105** (10): 11 contender **Nagisoid** (10): Should've won idc (and if I did the rate it would have but it's not a big deal to me at all) **qazz23** (10): yes, this one sure is fun; really good vocals, chorus, and guitar sound **RandomHypnotica** (10): I for one think paramore needs MORE rate wins **Runaway3212** (10): it isnt but thank you for asking **sarcasticsobs** (10): Hayley Williams if you read this I'm free on Thursday night and would like to hang out.

Either way, this was just okay **icantlikeeveryone** (3): It's a safe song and the melody is kind of, boring? I had listened to it few times before and still don't like it, although the lyric has nice meaning. **pbk** (2): i cannot beat the paramore hater allegations if we keep making me rate paramore songs i hate **jirachi** (0): possibly the most boring bland nothingburger song ever, this somehow got worse as time passes by **jman457** (0): Im sorry this song has terrorized me for too long **nt96** (0):",

A pretty solid, low mid tier Rihanna single but this would make the absolute worst winner **fadedblue09** (0): fuck Chris Brown and fuck this song **Ghost-Quartet** (0): Got some flack for giving this a zero in MPGGB so I feel like I owe people a better explanation this time around... basically I was a kid when this song came out and siblings and I would watch music videos on VH1 in the morning while we got ready for school (because that was still a thing back then) and the music video for this really scared me, like I would get so scared whenever this song came on. I couldn't understand what she was saying in the lyrics so to make it less frightening I kinda made up my own silly lyrics and the tail end of the pre-chorus (right before she starts saying \"Disturbia\") I pretended she was saying \"Michael Wazowski is hot,\" and so now whenever I hear the song I just think about Rihanna trying to have sex with that little green cyclops from *Monsters Inc.*. That's also why I don't like the song \"S&M,\" it makes me think about Rihanna pooping in someone's car. And also honestly I just don't really like how a lot of early Rihanna singles sound, but I guess that's beside the point.",

In 2023 they released a deluxe edition for the album. I was adamant that First Class Suicide was an awful title and going to be an even worse song. It is without a doubt one of the best tracks theyve ever put out. Funny how it happened twice, and as a result I will no longer be trying to predict the style Hollywood Undead will take with each song they release.

Then I lost the CD and also forgot the title of the album for the longest time. When streaming started popping up I tried to find this song. I looked through her albums and mused that it was probably on this one, but I couldn't find any title that I felt feasibly could be this song. So I went through her discography trying to find a song whose title seem to fit the song, I remembered. Ultimately, I started wondering if the song even existed. Then one day, in like 2014-2015, I put on a playlist of 70s music and all of the sudden, there it was. I was shocked that this title I had seen so many times, thinking it possible couldn't be my song was actually it. Terrible title and it kept me away from a wonderful song for nearly a decade.",

It's wordy, but not messy or meandering, and actually fits the rhythm of the song quite well, with some pretty banger lyrics.

I haven't heard too many other kpop tracks in this vein (at least, not since gen 1) so this was a nice refresher. I'm kind of morbidly curious to see how this one performs against the OG rnb tracks in the rate, since it clearly draws such heavy inspiration from those scenes. --- ## Host comment **1998tweety** (10): oh she washed her other bandmates I know they were pissed a little ## just cuz it's a throwback does not mean it's bad **Ghost-Quartet** (10): This coming right after '90s R&B princess was such a mindfuck because it sounds just like it could be from that era, major bop. **sarcasticsobs** (10): I can recognize that this is kinda derivative but also recognize that I don't care. Contain multitudes, etc., etc. **vayyiqra** (10): It's a 90s R&B LARP and it's perfect. **Verboten\\_Prince** (10): I just love this song so much Like who knew a k-pop artist could actually do r&b without a bad backing track, wearing tacky braids, or butchering AAVE **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): \"you go girl\". this is one of the stronger early 2000 throwbacks that kpop's affinity for american hip hop/pop 'n b has gunned for and worked out. jive records radio ready mix/master **pheromenos** (9.3): omg thought we were still in the 90s r&b princesses section  **stealthamo** (9): Kinda funny I think this is a better 90's R&B song than the two 90's R&B songs in this rate. **NervousLemon6670** (8.5): Genuinely thought until the vocals kicked in that this was part of the 90's R&B rate **kerriekipje** (8): Im giving this a point lower than I scored it in its original rate because compared to the rest of these songs its just kind of more underwhelming, also the fact that this song comes right after the actual r&b songs in the playlist is such a setup  **qazz23** (8): has a good R&B sound **welcome2thejam** (8): Some solid pop&b **jman457** (7.6): Nice little 90s throwback moment **buildingigloos** (6): I thought this was another song from the 90s R&B Princesses rate then. It's wild seeing Natty as a kid on Sixteen to now. Good for her **daftsone** (6): Not a bad love letter to 90s R&B, yet still feeling modern enough to be worth a listen **flava** (5): the way I had completely blocked this from my mind. I know 90s R&B Princesses wasnt the most successful rate ever but maybe we need more of them because the fact this made it to the top 3 of its rate is proof that the people crave it **apatel27** (3): This sounds so much worse being after two songs that are good rnb **nt96** (3): talk about kiss of death. putting this right after actual R&B songs feels like a set up [host note: maybe you should've left a comment on those 'good r&b' songs too then omg i couldn't make a host comments section] ## complex is overrated, this song is underrated **Ayzrules** (11): i dont really have a good reason for giving this an 11 besides that i just like it a lot lol. The beat, vocals, everythingthis is the y2k revival in kpop that i want!! **akanewasright** (10): not to be a dick but I think about the k-poppie who *passionately* hated all R&B k-pop tracks so much **icantlikeeveryone** (10): OMG I LOVE THIS SONG!! I think Natty's vocal is super clear here, and the smooth RnB is amazing. **jirachi** (10): banger **Lynflower680** (10): How did I forget about this banger???? **Nagisoid** (10): Natty was at her lowest...fat, nasty and broke.

Discovery was a fun discovery (pun intended), I sob to Since I Left You since, and sorry to  for tanking originally - its an electro clash bop **innuendo\\_overdose** (10.000): i SERIOUSLY underscored Since I Left You, like it was bad.

I struggle to connect with this song because of logistical questions like these that I dont believe are answered satisfactorily. **BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Fuck militarism and all that, but man the classic sailor suit is such a good look. **Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Thinking about how *The Cher Show* (the Cher Broadway musical) is framed as Cher reminiscing over her past but instead of it just being a flashback she like, literally turns back time by singing this song. **nonchalantthoughts** (8.3): isnt cher timeless? **Verboten\\_Prince** (8.2): This is nice but also kinda plain sorry mama Cher **NervousLemon6670** (8.1): And to think, she only read the Wikihow **mustwinfullgaming** (8): okay as a musty Gen Z who hasn't really heard Cher's music, this could be the thing that gets me to listen to Cher more. Skibidi toilet? **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this album was so bad but at least it had this song on it **vayyiqra** (8): Weird how this video was so controversial like \"ooh Cher is disrespecting the US navy dressing like a floozy\" They let her use their ship and probably had a blast filming it.

I like the vibe here, but I don't feel that this captivates me as much as other tracks in the rate. --- ## Would meet people Monica on the dancefloor **BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I know Monica won this rate, but I still think she was robbed overall and Im glad the hosts sent this song.

I also remember why I score this in the 8 range and don't go up to a 9. it's a workhorse but i don't find myself head over heels. mary j blige albums have SIMILAR effects on me to date! we're working on this.

Just isnt my favourite from that album **Stryxen** (7): production tea but her voice is kinda really bad this woman confuses me ## still would meet Monica on the dancefloor probably (who are we kidding) but not as enthusiastically **Verboten\\_Prince** (6.7): Tag yourself Im the guy in the background going no no no no no **stealthamo** (6.5): Whatever that vocal snippet is that loops throughout the song just took me out of it. **implasdad** (6.2): its giving.. 90s girls group vibes **icantlikeeveryone** (6): A fun song to listen to. **IIIHenryIII** (6): it has no replay value **TiltControls** (6): It's nice, but not at the top of my Monica must listens **Awkward\\_King** (5.5): a great deepcut from this album and i think i gave it a 10 in the rate but here it just kinda,.. shrinks **bogo** (5): huh, it's not hitting for me here **Runaway3212** (4): a bore",

Ok I have very mixed feelings on this. On one hand, I think the song captures the the feelings of being torn between wanting to be with someone of the same gender but at the same time drowning in doubt and fear because youre in an unaccepting environment very well. Its a topic that hits close to home for me. That said, the only thing(s) keeping me from giving this an 10 is everything surrounding the band. Like, the whole band is the product of one creep projecting his lesbian fetish on these two teenage girls. Like, the things their manager made them do while underage is vile. Add on top of that one of the members being homophobic herself (despite being bi) and becoming a shill for the Russian government, I cant really give more points to this. Normally Im good with separating the art from the artist, but here I cant fully do that because of everything I just mentioned. Its just, damn. **WindysaStarStarStar** (7): its fine, but I kept my score high to not be accused of lesbian crimes **seanderlust** (6): okay wait so i did a deep dive into the whole t.A.T.u. queerbaiting thing and apparently one of them went on a game show in 2014 and said she would disown her son if he was gay but not her daughter if she was a lesbian :confusedsob: hello???? the other one seems okay, she just did the queerbaiting (which tbf she could be bisexual! we don't know!) **pbk** (1): i hate a fake gay bitch!!!!!!!!!! ## queerbaiting .. neutral **TiltControls** (7): queerbaiting anthem **welcome2thejam** (7):  **CrimsonROSET** (6): invented queerbaiting ## queerbaiting .. good? **1998tweety** (10): faux lesbian serve **Ambrosia42** (10): the first CD i ever bought was t.A.T.u. and i kinda stan. I had to take gay representation wherever I could get it, even if it was from a homophobic bisexual woman and a straight woman **buildingigloos** (10): Wish I could give another 11. As a kid, I used to worry about them being locked in a cage in the rain, and I couldn't do anything to save them. It showed me that it was okay for a girl to kiss another girl, and that girls kissing was hot.

Anora don't make that face!!! **NervousLemon6670** (8.4): Very smooth and sensual track but could do with a little trimming from the 7 minute length **Poydoo** (8.4): this is really nice but it doesn't have the same cunt factor as if i could turn back time **Verboten\\_Prince** (8.2): We support female entrepreneurs **CrimsonROSET** (8): we need more proper anthems for ladies of the night **qazz23** (8): dark and haunting sound with some nice  **vayyiqra** (8): Don't care for her voice but I have a thing for sophistipop so I like it. It's budget Sade **ConnerY2323** (7.7): tinora (dir. sean baker) **1998tweety** (7.5): I wanna like this more but wow it drags **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): wait why was she lowkey giving goth here **emayzee** (6.3): anora: **buildingigloos** (6): I'm a little bit stoned and it feels like I was born listening to this song and I will die listening to this song ## longsongphobia **camerinian** (6): yeah longsongphobia whatever whatever some songs just dont need to be 7+ minutes ok **daftsone** (6): Quite the legendary song, soft and gentle at times, that is until Tina decides to send it **mustwinfullgaming** (6): okay originally it wasn't doing it for me but it improved for me with more time...maybe this is why we need longer songs back **stealthamo** (6): Love the production, like Tina's voice. But the two combined felt weird to me. **team\\_kockroach** (6): Tender and sensual, but Ive heard songs in this vein that were executed much better. I like the sax solo but it really doesnt do much for me. **TiltControls** (6): Looove Tina, but never really cared for this track compared to her others. And especially with such strong competitors in All Stars **Ayzrules** (5.5): i dont like how nasally the vocals are rip. Also docking some more points because this song is SO LONG **hikk** (5): longsongphobia... **welcome2thejam** (5): Seven minutes? Tina's indie era? **icantlikeeveryone** (2): It has decent instrument, but I really am distracted by the vocal.... **pheromenos** (2): sorry queen i love the best but this is not for me ## LONGSONGPHOBIA (so confidently wrong with the capslock) **RandomHypnotica** (5): there is ZERO reason for this to be 7 minutes long",

Listening to this song on its own. I gave it a higher rating after watching the music video. I am so charmed by the lo-fi footage, cheesy dance moves, and 90s CD-ROM video game graphics. ## it wasn't really in the plan (to rerate this) **daftsone** (7): This is some real solid synthpop, couldve stood being a bit longer to really sell it **IIIHenryIII** (7): its a good song, Im just butthurt she got 2 spots instead of Chappell **Runaway3212** (7): Shouldve been Sever The Blight **sarcasticsobs** (7): Don't think I'm into these vocal affectations that much **marbIeIily** (6.9): Santiago Calatrava doesnt have shit on Hemlocke Springs!! **babadork** (6.7): I dont actually remember Hemlocke Springs being in this rate. **TiltControls** (6): It never really grew on me like many of the other songs from Slumber Party did.

I know I'm on record as a Taylor anti & I promise I have really tried with this woman's music (a Swiftie sister has made sure of that), but absolutely nothing about this appeals - the lyrics feel childish, the cheerleader cadence similarly juvenile, and the vocals vaguely whiny - it's just grating in all the worst ways. --- ## Host comment **ignitethephoenix** (10): style better but this is still one of her best ## so it's gonna be forever **IIIHenryIII** (11): there is another excellent contender in the rate that deserve an 11, but its not pop perfection **ricki** (11): see i could have been fun and give the pussycat dolls my 11 but instead i gotta give it to the best song ever for a 4th time **skylofte2** (11): deserves 11 private jets for this **1998tweety** (10): her best pop hit **Ayzrules** (10): im not a swiftie by any definition of the term but i do really really enjoy this song - the more minimalistic, rhythmic beat with a speak-singing melody over top is a perfectly manufactured key to my heart<3 **BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh this underrated, indie gem **Content\\_Love5312** (10): This song and music video is the reason I became a late in life Swiftie in 2014.

I feel like the past decade, she's attempted a few more times to sorta take public perception of her and flip it on its head and take control of narrative and each time its kinda fallen flat for me but this one? She had the world in her hands here **Runaway3212** (10): but what a moments **seanderlust** (10): living proof that taylor swift can be self-aware and even more, funny! also, we give taylor a lot of shit (rightfully so in some cases) but this quote from a rolling stone interview got me - \"I think the way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic. I used to go into this thinking, Maybe this is the onewell get married and have a family, this could be forever.

    "Okay, hear me out here. Yes, Rainbow Connection is a song from a kids movie, yes Kermit's voice is rough but think about the lyrics for a second. It's a direct rejection of the when you wish upon a star-style magical thinking - it's saying that that sort of blind faith in a divine intervention making your dreams come true only leads to disappointment and bitterness. It's about facing that bleak truth and still rejecting the pessimism that might come with that - the song still chooses to say \"there's good reason to be hopeful and to keep searching for happiness.\" If that's not worth songeniality I don't know what is.

    "## or it's gonna go down in flames **marbIeIily** (6.6): I was lucky enough to have the 1989 album co-incide with my middle school years and the schoolbus got turnt asf everytime Radio Disney played this between What Does the Fox Say? and Same Old Love **camerinian** (6): you cannot make me willingly listen to blank space again ok im just copying my score from the original rate and hoping it bears out with the tone of this comment (nvm it was a 7.5 initially but Im feeling spiteful today) **CrimsonROSET** (6): shake it off continues to outsell **frogaranaman** (6): I cannot, in good faith and out of principle, give Taylor Swift a 10 in All Stars but this is good enough for me **sarcasticsobs** (6): lol it's da \"Starbucks lovers\" song. I've really soured on this, and the snare sound sucks, but the chorus is still p. great **vayyiqra** (6): It's fine but was never my favourite from the album and I'm so bored of it **daftsone** (5): Decent enough pop song, but its nothing to write home about **flava** (5): Im never been crazy about this one, always feel it gets a bit grating if I listen to it too much, even if I love the sharp as hell songwriting **nonchalantthoughts** (5): nevermind this song is annoying, I guess I had nostalgia-glasses when I did this rate (doesnt warrant a 0 though) **Poydoo** (5): this song would be great but i can not get over that loud ass snare  **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is the i prevail cover lowkey better **buildingigloos** (4): This has been so overplayed that the opening notes fill me with dread. I'm not a swiftie, I went to the Eras tour with my sister (who is) and by the time 1989 came around I was beyond ready to go back to the hotel and go to bed. I used to love it though **apatel27** (3): Heard this thousands of times now and every time it gets worse **qazz23** (3): sounds generic, the drumming is annoying too **static\\_int\\_husp** (1): I am on record for thinking that 1989 is my least favorite Taylor record. This is mostly because I think it's the culmination of early 2010s mainstream pop tends, which I did not like. Luckily for it, there's a worse offender here, so it does not get bottom billing. **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (1): why did tayswif ever think showing her true colors on this cut were what the world needed!?!?",

Nobody is doing like her ## Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop **Ambrosia42** (10): I think this song is too sophisticated for some people to understand **CrimsonROSET** (10): lmao **Frajer** (10): Isis Spices isn't the first prophet to be misunderstood in her time **frogaranaman** (10): cackling **ImADudeDuh** (10): **innuendo\\_overdose** (10): THIS IS NOT BAD ur all just kinkshamers **Nagisoid** (10): It was too high concept for some people. **pbk** (10): this is a setup but any ice spice song wouldve been a setup so i'll take what i can get. this overhated bop yall cant handle hearing the word fart ya damn babies. yes i am calling ice spice haters baby ears i stand on business **pheromenos** (10): its fun... **Runaway3212** (10): this absolute banger still **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): giving this a 10 solely for darius' comment which made me crack a smile before then going on a 3 paragraph tear about his nyc hip hop bonafides. yeah dude, i got it already with the joke! **camerinian** (9): ice spice only performing at new years for 5 minutes before getting kicked off was the talk of the down under summer, so in respect of the single point in history where shell ever be able to get away with it I gotta give her big points for now only **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): may she get the 4+ controversy she deserves **PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Once you get over the goofy-ahh line this is actually not that bad of a beat. I fuck with this hard. **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): horrible song **uiscebeathaoir** (8): Seriously, whats yalls problem with this **IIIHenryIII** (7): why would she waste such a sick beat **NervousLemon6670** (6.9): Honestly it's nowhere near as bad as the title line would have me believe but that doesn't mean it's good **jman457** (6.7): The start of scat fetish era, but it goes off. **icantlikeeveryone** (6.5): I really like the beat but dislike Ice Spice's voice. **stealthamo** (6.5): Male rappers have so many poop lines and nobody bats an eye. Ice Spice does it and the world is ending. **Awkward\\_King** (6): sometimes you just need to stop playing with em riot.. this is a good song there's just better here unfortunately **welcome2thejam** (6): [Remembering the shitpost I used in FPR]( **ignitethephoenix** (5.5): it would be easy to give this a 0 but this will be hated enough already (but the beat is actually so good) **apatel27** (5): I mean sure **BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): You think youre the feature presentation? Bitch, you aint even the preview! ## think u the ice bitch? u not even water **babadork** (4.3): I must have been in a really good mood when I was doing the Rap Girl Vanguard rate, because I gave this way too high of a score **Ayzrules** (4): the beat/rapping isnt actually bad (to my uneducated ears) but what the hell is the concept of this song **hikk** (4): the last hurrah before we leave ice spice in 2024 **NFLfreak98** (4): my favorite, a song thats not very good but its supposed to be kinda bad so you cant really criticize it just for that. and honestly outside of the whole titular line its a pretty reasonable song **slimboyfriend** (4): wow shes REALLY good!! **team\\_kockroach** (4): How is this two-minute song too long. **akanewasright** (3): of course yall sent this **marbIeIily** (3): We couldve been giving Bree Runway her deserved redemption but I guess we needed somebody to go home first **Verboten\\_Prince** (2.2): Wow. yall remember Ice Spice **buildingigloos** (2): At least we know for definite Ice writes her own raps. **ConnerY2323** (2): the super saiyan mention is what saved this from 0 territory **Content\\_Love5312** (2): \"I never cared for Ice Spice\" [As Lucille Bluth] **dreamingpastel** (2): I can't tell if Ice Spice is being legit or dead unserious. **krusso1105** (2): A serious 0 contender. Why do the synths even sound kind of farty. Got an extra point for a DBZ reference. **seanderlust** (2): ...yeah i think Latto won this beef. good beat tho **1998tweety** (1): its not for me but Im glad the scat girlies have some representation **asadprofessorplum** (1): This is just retrospectively embarrassing after Doechiis rise to stardom **bogo** (1): i don't even have anything else to say about this song I'm not putting in effort to trash it just like how ice spice didn't put in any effort in making this song. I expect this to be the last time i will ever have to think about ice spice because i highly doubt she will ever be relevant again **flava** (1): songs that make me wish i didnt understand english **Ghost-Quartet** (1): The Ice Spice phenomenon was just fascinating to witness in real time... like people were fully making fun of her at the start of it and then they just kind of forgot and she became a real thing, and then the world had to reckon with the fact that she didn't actually have anything to offer. Glad she got some money at least. **impla77** (1): yeah I didn't need this in my life again **sarcasticsobs** (1): Hm. **wathombe** (1): only thing saving this from a second 0 is nysnc **daftsone** (0): I think this was supposed to come across as clever, but its just not **indie\\_fan\\_** (0): stop all that mothafuckin yellin, ho. cause i ain't buyin that ya sellin, ho. think i'm the shit, bitch? I know it ho! Jesus walked on water, i got ice boilin tho. **lexiaredery** (0): All the good Ice Spice songs in this rate, why this one?? **RainbowSherbet47** (0): Probably the easiest zero Ive given **RandomHypnotica** (0): this really solidifed her career trajectory **TiltControls** (0): well that made picking a 0 a lot easier ## these girls are vulgar **qazz23** (3): shit fart **jirachi** (1): fart fart fart poop poop poop **FitzMarble** (0): shit ## you tell em impla's dad **implasdad** (3.1): bit rude ## No **Lynflower680** (0): No **vayyiqra** (0): no",

Honestly this was GREAT fun, super catchy and doesn't take itself too seriously. Loving the bouncy feel and hoping this does well. [post rate closure stare of pain] --- ## Host comment **Ghost-Quartet** (10): There were \"better\" Remi Wolf songs I could have sent to this rate but if we're being honest, this was like THE Remi song that had everybody talking so it just felt right to keep the conversation going. I had the house to myself once so I stood in front of my bathroom mirror and sang along to this entire song, including the monologue at the end, and then realized afterwards that my stepmom was actually still downstairs and she heard the whole thing. We didn't talk about it. ## paying their debts and stealing corvettes **Awkward\\_King** (11): there were too many amazing songs on juno for me to 11 this originally so i'm glad i get to here. this is really just non stop quotable lines, catchy as hell, it's just remi going off on the mic and its sickening this was maybe the point at which i went from just a remi listener to actually a remi diehard fan. ORGY AT FIVE GUYS WITH FIVE GUYS THATS TEN GUYS HOLY CHRIST I'VE NEVER SEEN MORE NUTS IN MY LIIIIIFE **apatel27** (10): If you get it you get it **Frajer** (10): I guess 212 isn't the only Bling Ring song in this rate if she's stealing cars **innuendo\\_overdose** (10): first ever Remi Wolf stream, and suddenly I understand her whole deal. I will be streaming Big Ideas posthaste **NFLfreak98** (10): probably as many quotable lines here than half of the rest of this rate combined **pbk** (10): the girls that get it get it (it=lost in the store and cant find my mommy) **RandomHypnotica** (10): Y'all should learn about the skip button, it's a great feature **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (10): oh she likes justin timberlake like me! oh she likes middle school pop like me! The entire MO of this cut is designed for \"AP Econ Music Videos\". If you KNOW what I'm talking about, then you know. the uwu shit at the end clenches it **wathombe** (10): banger **welcome2thejam** (10): Bitch!!! **CrimsonROSET** (9): the way yall did remi so wrong in the rate and this one is only gonna be worse **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this was so fun like the girls that get it get it yk **stealthamo** (9): What do you mean Pharrell didn't produce this? **Stryxen** (9): It's Oh So Quiet on Set **Ayzrules** (8.7): love this beat **slimboyfriend** (8.6): eating my ass like the human centipede!! **Content\\_Love5312** (8): I have been meaning to listen to Remi Wolf. This song's maximalism works so well. I'm adding Juno to my queue. **vayyiqra** (8): Can never decide if Remi is fun or annoying or both but I'm vaguely positive on Remi if not an outright truther **bogo** (7): what is wrong with her **daftsone** (7): Its just a big ol ball of fun **jirachi** (7): the 5 guys line still goes hard sorry **mustwinfullgaming** (7): okay I like this more than most Remi Wolf songs I've heard...human centipede reference too I see you girl **sarcasticsobs** (7): Some of the lyrics, jfc lol **team\\_kockroach** (7): First heard of this song because Fantano said it was one of his favorite songs of 2021. The production is a little too wonky for me, but I think this is a perfect fit for an All Stars rate. **Verboten\\_Prince** (7): Maybe this would be a 10 if it was just the chorus and the rest was instrumental **ignitethephoenix** (6.8): why does this song sound like Rock Your Body by JT  **jman457** (6.8): Its catchy but the ending was catchy **ConnerY2323** (6.2): this suffers a bit when im comparing it to tori amos instead of baby queen ## debbie debbie debbie debbie downers **BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Im sorry Remi. Most of the song is a bop, but I still dislike this outro. Thankfully, she will be in All Winners 5 after we rate Big Ideas :nodding: **jasannn** (6): I can't listen to this song without thinking about Dan Schnieder.. **kerriekipje** (6): its not for me but I can see why people would appreciate it **DirtyRat583** (5): what is it with music school students making the corniest music ever **IIIHenryIII** (5): popheads keep telling me shes good, but I just cant get into her music **implasdad** (5): its not that good really **babadork** (4.8): It could only be worse if the Red Hot Chili Peppers song got chosen **camerinian** (4): saw remi live literally within the past week and had a great time and I hoped thatd help her music on record not come across so obnoxious but alas **Poydoo** (4): nice production but the rest is ehhhhh **Runaway3212** (4): some of these lines sound like theyre straight out of an eminem song **icantlikeeveryone** (3): I think Remi Wolf is just not my taste, as I only like a handful of her songs, and this song is not one of those as it sounds super childish, but that's fine. **marbIeIily** (2.5): If Id used my zero this rate this probably wouldve been the unlucky recipient, but the evil Mario game sounding beat just barely saved it **1998tweety** (2): this is not great Im sorry **indie\\_fan\\_** (1.2): there's a reason i skipped this rate [3] **asadprofessorplum** (0): This might be one of the worst songs of the entire century and I mean that so seriously. How did this sneak past the lashings it deserves? **flava** (0): maybe one of the worst songs weve ever rated, just feels like the sonic equivalent of 2000s torture porn schlock with all the subtlety of a Michael Bay directed film and it turns me the fuck off. None of the lyrics in this song needed to be written, none of the melodies made needed to be made **ImADudeDuh** (0): **nonchalantthoughts** (0): if the word annoying was a song ## reminder that chappell had 7(!) songs in the top 10 and was obviously having a song voted in **ricki** (0): not only is this an awful song but it was also over any chappell roan song ## she didn't do anything wrong! **frogaranaman** (10): the voice at the end is fine, you guys just force yourself to hate one artist per rate for some god forsaken reason **seanderlust** (10): This song rules please pretend you do not see the outro **lexiaredery** (9.5): This is so much fun to listen to on it's own kinda randomly and not in the midst of the album. I do have to lower my score because of the child at the end though **krusso1105** (8.5): Once again this would be higher rated without that outro. Also we need to rate Big Ideas. **Goorry121** (8): the outro takes 2 points out of the song **PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Lots of good vibes up until that Angelica Pickles-ahh outro **qazz23** (8): like the low bass sounds on this, good flow also (yes that ending is bad but doesn't ruin the whole song) **Roxieloxie** (7.8): drives me insane how this song is actually so good and the outro just undoes all its good will in the outro to the point that makes me lower my score **uiscebeathaoir** (6.5): oh Id forgotten about the fucking baby **zadooi** (6): I initially scored this higher, but I hate the outro. **dreamingpastel** (5): I still don't really like that baby voice at the end. **hikk** (5): this is a really good two minute song **TiltControls** (4): Can I give this two different scores for the front half and back half? Like give me a '(Radio Edit)' version and I'll be all over that **NervousLemon6670** (3): If you put baby voice in the song you get tanked it's a very simple rule **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): me when im in a worst outro of all time competition and my opponent is remi wolf - quiet on set **impla77** (0): the baby section is irredeemable and I don't particularly enjoy the rest of the song either",

It is a perfectly fine mid 00s bop and reminds me of feeling really socially anxious at a school dance. **Poydoo** (3.8): never liked this **innuendo\\_overdose** (3.5): i dont appear to dig it anymore **daftsone** (3): Was never a big fan of The Pussycat Dolls, and this song isnt changing my mind any time soon **flava** (3): sure whatever **nonchalantthoughts** (2.6): dont cha is so much better, be for me **icantlikeeveryone** (1.5): It's super outdated song with some cringe lyrics... like the \"I'm sexy mama\", but the adlibs are good. **welcome2thejam** (1): No thanks ## slaysian divas of la **jirachi** (10): i love you slaysian diva of LA **slimboyfriend** (8.7): maybe Thee Slaysian Diva of LA only ever heard the album version sans snoop verse **Verboten\\_Prince** (7.1): We are all slaysian divas of LA on this blessed day ## tate mcdolls **ignitethephoenix** (10): Tate McRae reheated their French fries alongside Nellys nachos **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): tate mcrae wanted their nachos **WindysaStarStarStar** (7): tanking a bit bc they let Tate sample it for her song but it wasnt much better than the og ## (g)i-dolls **Ambrosia42** (10): the ethnic hip **Awkward\\_King** (8): we need to go back to letting popstars get a little asian with it as long as they slayed **asadprofessorplum** (5): Nothing about this song needed an ethnically ambiguous melody as the beat. **vayyiqra** (4): This kind of sucks and is one of the lesser 2000s ethnic-hip \"ooh vaguely ~Eastern melody\" hits. **apatel27** (0): Do your part against racism and let this song drown ## wait wrong kpop group **pheromenos** (9): pussykatseye ",

Maybe its the chord progression, or maybe its the main melody thats too sparse? **Ghost-Quartet** (6): I will once again reiterate how weird it is that this song became known as some sunny feelgood bop when the lyrics are actually about a toxic relationship with a destructive woman. **krusso1105** (6): Tbh I would probably dislike this more if I didn't associate it with the excellent movie it comes from ## people who are bad-bad nevertheless **babadork** (5.3): I really dislike Swae Lees voice, but the contrast with Post Malone is kind of nice **Ambrosia42** (5): i still dont get the hype for this song idk.

Its so mecoded, I routinely ask why are there people on the road rn, its 4:30 AM while fully being on the road myself at 4:30 AM **seanderlust** (10): one of my favorite bits in this song is how insanely white the girl sounds saying \"that's so ratchet\" **Stryxen** (10): the fact they call a girl fake and ratchet for going out on a Monday while they're at the club with her it was so conceptual. the unreliable narrator reveal. **vayyiqra** (10): Like many meme songs I wound up enjoying by putting it on an \"ironic\" meme playlist and what psychologists call the mere exposure effect. It's not even funny to me, I'm simply brainrotted by it somehow.[ Exception: I die laughing every time I hear the stereotypical white girl in the club say \"THAT'S. SO.

Honestly, yes, but we did what we had to do. Well, we didnt HAVE to do it, but it felt that way at the time. ## i shed a tear as i read this comment **Awkward\\_King** (9): THEY CALL ME KUNTALA!!! on one hand it saddens me slightly that khia has been reduced to a meme and ironic stannage bc she really is a great rapper and thug misses is a great album but also i know good and well there is much unironic stannage of this song and that makes me contented ## drag race talent show **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this drag race talent show original track realness **CrimsonROSET** (6): how has no one done this in a drag race talent show yet **asadprofessorplum** (3): Drag Race talent shows: ## happy **Ambrosia42** (10): this gospel **Content\\_Love5312** (10): Thank you r/popheads for introducing me to the first Khia song outside I have heard of outside of My Neck, My Back.

Loved that (even if it was probably just kind of an indicator that raters make up a significant proportion of the people who do other subreddit activities) **jasannn** (7): its not as campy good outside of charity rate context **TiltControls** (7): It's not 10 worthy in a field this strong, but I think I underestimated how much fun this song was the first time we rated it **welcome2thejam** (7): I'm laughing at her telling us to look it up **flava** (6): khia had her only hit and some random deepcut that only a certain brand of terminally online gay has heard rated in the past 12 months, and were rating the latter again.

Since this was a vote-in, I know there will be some passionate defenders of the camp classic, but will it be enough? I, for one, am one of them! This is just so STUPID, I can't help but dance to it - the percussion is genuinely entrancing and the whole tongue-in-cheek vibe is enough to distract from the fever-dream that is will.i.am's coco pops line.

I have really mixed feelings on this track myself and I always find myself struggling with how to score it. It IS undeniably catchy, with an addictive bassline, a gorgeously sparkly pre-chorus, and an admittedly incredibly catchy chorus. I'm also a total sucker for chant-vocals in tracks, so I have to admit that it's lots of fun and I can see why it's so well-loved. That said... I *want* to give this points for its ridiculous (camp?) lyrics, but I always find myself kind of wrapped up with how the supposed 'be yourself' message of the song feels totally at odds with the way (G)-IDLE market themselves. It feels more than a little disingenuous to focus the track on self-love, rejecting surgery etc. while also filling the video with filters and heavily edited shots. I'm almost certainly thinking too much about this, but these obnoxious feminist thoughts kind of cloud my enjoyment of the track whenever I hear it, so I'm deducting a few points on that basis. --- ## Host comments **1998tweety** (10): the girls that get it get it and the girls that don't arent hot ## sing it with me in the queup **CrimsonROSET** (10): shes right my boob AND booty is hot **dreamingpastel** (10): **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): KWINKA!

It's minimal and restrained, which I guess might be interpreted as a little dull (7 minutes of this no less) - but listen closely, and those darkly murmured lyrics about lack of self-worth in the face of a patriarchal society cut *deep*. The switch-up is both inexplicable and makes perfect sense, this moody transition into a bitter, repetitive, almost defeated refrain reflects her mental state. I have heard this quite a few times, but it always makes me stop to collect my thoughts and reflect on the miserable state of modern womanhood. I think it's worth a solid score for that alone. **beeozan** (6): unexpectedly grew on me once i stopped taking it seriously lol. it still sounds like Vigilante shit once it switches. thats pretty funny. jimi jimi coco puff jimi jimi yaaa. need a mashup of the second half with My Humps --- ## thank u ricki **letsallpoo** (10): tagging myself so i know when to join queup to watch ricki's video again u/letsallpoo **Nagisoid** (10): The ricki shitpost lives rent free in my head **Runaway3212** (10): I think about rickis stan twitter shitpost for this every day **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): rickis music video singlehandedly made this grow on me **TiltControls** (8): this would be a 4 without ricki's video. it's amazing what good visuals can do to help you appreciate music **CrimsonROSET** (7): the ricki video kinda the best campaign move because why did it make me raise my score for this **welcome2thejam** (6): Still don't care for it, but I'm increasing the score thanks to the power of the Ricki A&W edit that is hopefully currently playing in the queup **pbk** (1): spared of a 0 bc we get to watch the ricki video again ## we already listened to enough jason derulo on the queup **NervousLemon6670** (7.3): During the back half I kept expecting it to launch into \"Shimmy shimmy yay shimmy yay shimmy yah (DRANK) swallallalah\" ## \"oh i am a big fan of prostitution\" **icantlikeeveryone** (11): The song that officially made me LDR's fan lol, it's supposed to be sad but somehow I fck with it so much and looped this while commuting. **jman457** (11): Best song ever made idc.. **1998tweety** (10): sometimes the most popular song really is the best [2] **Awkward\\_King** (10): i must admit i didn't think she'd release anything this phenomenal again. it felt like NFR was a perfect odds defying swan song and then there was question for the culture and two lackluster albums in one year it felt like NFR was a magical one-time gift of her talent used perfectly. but A&W is just.... she's still got it man she's never losing it, even if it can be fleeting.. what a song **buildingigloos** (10): I first listened to this with my girlfriend and when the breakdown came we both looked at each other like we couldn't believe how good it was. It still gives me chills. This is the experience of being an American whore. **ConnerY2323** (10): some of you cant handle a sprawling american epic. why is this kinda the brutalist of songs. **Content\\_Love5312** (10): Lana's best song out of her entire career. I just love when that trap beat comes in and she scats about jimmy cocoa puff. Unfortunately, Jack Antonoff has had a hand in nearly all of the the pop music I that love. This was my runner-up for an 11 rating **Frajer** (10): boo you American whore **hikk** (10): this is going to flop so bad here probably which is crazyyyyy **IIIHenryIII** (10): this wont win, but its the song that deserves it the most **impla77** (10): how will you know if someone hates this song? dw they'll tell you like 10 times **innuendo\\_overdose** (10): the pushback on this one I dont get, surely its obviously the best song ever made? hating this is denialism on par with moon landing doubt tbh **uiscebeathaoir** (10): this was so robbed its insanity **wathombe** (10): brilliant brilliant brilliant **krusso1105** (9.5): would easily be a 10 in a less stacked rate **team\\_kockroach** (9.5): Yeah, this ones fucking peak, and I have a hard time believing that Antonoff can top this song. I hope no one tanks it in this rate. **BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Lots of songs are elevated by rate shitposts, but not as many are ascended by them. **vayyiqra** (9): Under no circumstances do we \"have to hand it\" to Lana, **WindysaStarStarStar** (9): Jimmy Choos are making her high? Is she a shopaholic? **nonchalantthoughts** (8.9): I used to be obsessed with this song **ImADudeDuh** (8.5): **sarcasticsobs** (8): Anybody else have those KFC + A&W combos in the same building? Similar to the Taco Bell + Long John Silver combo buildings? God Bless America **seanderlust** (8): i think antonoff over-saturation has waned enough for us to all admit that sometimes he really can eat **NFLfreak98** (7.8): production on this is incredible but the first part lasts too long and to this day I still dont think I love the melody of the second part. Sounds beautiful all the way though just a lot of missed opportunities to me **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (7.8): lana del ray's mild ride. to quote the wise words of u/freav she is truly one of america's most \"reliable\" songwriters! **Ayzrules** (7.7): i really enjoy her voice, but it feels like nothing is happening for 80% of the song. Tbh its a testament to how much i enjoy LDR that im not tanking this song in general, if any other song spent like 3 full minutes with just vague instrumental backbeat going on itd be an instant 1 for me. [insert something about how my brain rot goldfish attention span is a sign that the YOUTHS cant be saved] **Verboten\\_Prince** (7.7): First she pretends to be Latina (changes her last name), now she pretends to be Asian (says she lives in Rosemead) **mustwinfullgaming** (7): I don't normally gel with Lana's music but this song is pretty good! I like it for how long it is and the 2 distinct phases it has **Poydoo** (7): idk this song has really never done a ton for me, I wish something else from the album made it in tbh **stealthamo** (7): My headcanon is she's talking to Jimmy from Degrassi. **zadooi** (7): It's good, but I truly do not get the hype with this song.

I'm taking some points out for that girl at the end. **moongenightmares** (8): balkanites rise up **lexiaredery** (7.5): This is pure elementary school nostalgia **IIIHenryIII** (7): Im not gonna lie, this is a 10, but not in this rate **Wane Lietoc, All Fun Cops Are Bastards Edition** (6.9): banked big on the drop in a year we were pivoting to golden age EDM. it's cute but feels like a stylistic rut or cul de sac more than the proper holy land we needed. pre-chorus is goofy shlock **emayzee** (6.8): i feel like jason derulo's output is the perfect way to track the trends of the '10s. imo the early era was pop perfection and this was not but maybe that was just me being a middle schooler vs pretentious high schooler **xophrys** (6): ,7 ## scoring dirty **implasdad** (5.5): i'm not the biggest Jason Derulo fan **apatel27** (5): Respect the pick even if it a bad one **stealthamo** (5): Jason Derulo's best song of 2014 (derogatory). **impla77** (4.3): this is bad in a fun way so at least its got that going for it **NFLfreak98** (4.2): saxophone carries this song out of the dumpster (and the sax isnt even produced very well imo) **nonchalantthoughts** (4.2): i am suddenly illiterate **qazz23** (4): the  sample is the only good thing about this **vayyiqra** (4): The saxophone hook is unfortunately catchy but the rest sucks **welcome2thejam** (4): Good news Remi Wolf, you no longer have the worst outro in All Stars 8 **ConnerY2323** (3): cannot imagine a sound less comparable to dirty talk than whatever is going on in that beat drop **fadedblue09** (3): Fifth Harmony did it better **FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): this is for imogen heap **krusso1105** (3): at least it's not Wiggle **asadprofessorplum** (2.4): This is so embarrassing to listen to and even more so to be perceived as listening to it. **NervousLemon6670** (2): I reckon we could get Jason Derulo in his new job as a reaction TikToker to react to a Popheads Rate reveal **Poydoo** (2): yeah this is terrible and normally it would loop around to being camp but idk i'm not feeling it today **slimboyfriend** (2): one of these 2014 BBH100 all star picks is not like the others I will say **TiltControls** (2): I will say those 5 seconds of pre-chorus hook are a 10 at least **icantlikeeveryone** (1.5): Jason Derulo is talented but he made annoying songs and idk why those became popular.... **uiscebeathaoir** (1.5): oh God its worse than I remember **daftsone** (1): If only there was some way to know who this song was performed by? **kerriekipje** (1): god this song is annoying **RandomHypnotica** (1): why did we get this in **sarcasticsobs** (1): God, he just sucks, all around, musically.

(EDIT: Well.) **Nagisoid** (0): Can we not... **team\\_kockroach** (0): I have a soft spot for the 2 Chainz verse at least.

    "Everyone wanted the heart-shaped vinyl. She definitely could have printed more, and it still would have sold out. She sold out 150k in the first hour",
    "A lot of her stuff is bought up by resellers. I know a girl who (with her \"team\") bought up TTPD vinyls, thinking they'd be easy to resell because of the frenzy but she ended up being out thousands of dollars and couldn't even resell them near cost. Her new plan is to storage them to sell in a few years. There definitely are fans who buy them up (obviously) but resellers jump in fast.",
    "It's just numbers, it has no cultural impact. Madonna's discography remains a reference and staple to pop music. Wtf is Lover (Live from Paris)?",
    "Wait thats actually completely insane lmao. Shes really become such a global powerhouse after the Eras Tour.",
    "I dont understand why this is randomly charting so well and hit no.1 ( THIS CAME OUT AGES AGO??)",
    "Impressive but on the other hand Madonna had TV (esp. MTV), a lot of radio play, a lot of promotion in paper media, greatest hits compilations (Taylor has none for sale) on her side. Social media is useless if you don't already have popularity irl.",
    "Yeah, Rep TV and Debut TV still to come out and likely TS12 after that. Theres the next 3 number ones.",
    "One of my favorite performances. I only wish Taylor had done backing vocals here, but it was so good.",
    "Hi, Lover live from Paris is available to stream Spotify? I listen to it constantly lol especially like you said Cornelia street, it IS the superior version for me. Unless I'm misunderstanding you mean by streaming?",
    "Most albums are collectors albums at this point, majority of people stream or buy digital copies.",
    "Madonna's records includes two greatest hits and ~~three~~ four (?) live albums, so they're pretty comparable! Super impressive for both artists.",
    "No theyve only just shipped in the UK this week",
    "The demand is insane for Taylor's music. People just can't get enough of her music.",
    "Lmao scalper resellers are trash, lowkey deserved to lose that money",
    "The first release was before covid hit and she only released 13000 vinyl copies so most fans missed out the first time. Its not available on streaming so we all jumped at the chance to get a copy when she quietly released another batch this year. She could easily have sold 4x the amount she put out, it was still a limited release this time around. I can only imagine the numbers if she released it digitally and on streaming with some PR.",
    "Its a heart-shaped vinyl. Even disregarding the music on it, if youre a vinyl collector and your favorite artist releases a vinyl thats weird and cool like that, wouldnt you jump at the chance to nab one?",
    "Cultivated a huge base of whales/collectors who are competing to own everything she releases.",
    "Also I don't know why this thread is acting like Madonna only released hits in like the 80s/90s. Madonna also benefited from social media for her later releases, her last UK no.1 album was in 2012! Her and Taylor Swift have a long period of overlap too!",
    "Madonna also existed when you had to leave the house to buy an album and the charts mattered.",
    "The songs on Spotify don't count as a lover live from paris unit, but it counts towards the studio lover album for some reason.",
    "It's on YouTube music too. Listen to it all the time, have been forever.",
    "I'm pretty sure 95% of people just stream, except maybe for one or two albums a year at most",
    "That includes me I just love her voice and her lyrics and storytelling. Shes risen to the top and stayed there in spite of people trying to bring her down and thats why she has so many loyal fans.",
    "Plus - folklore brought on a lot of new fans (like me!) who was totally unaware of this the first time round. I couldn't buy it this time round either lmao, but I would have liked to!",
    "Good point. Madonna benefited from the old and new system.",
    "Social media started to be massive only in 2010-2011 lol, so no Madonna didn't have social media throughout most of her career, especially her career highs we're all without social media.",
    "I know that shes never going to be considered a vocal powerhouse, but for me I dont always need or want to listen to belting (even if I can appreciate it). Ive just always loved her tone, especially speak now and on.",
    "Yes. Most of her fans are loyal. The ex-fans usually become loyal haters and still can't shut up about her. ",

    "OOOOOOOOOHHHHHH YES. Tate showcases her Britney influence to the fullest, this sounds like something that came out of In the Zone. Love the whispery chorus as well. Could use a bridge, though. 8/10",
    "i haven't been feeling her other songs this era but this one HITS... just crazy catchy and the 00s pastiche production is spot on. i love when she goes \"where'd you put those keys\" and the car cars it tickles my brain 9/10",
    "As a certified Tate Stan, this SLAPS!! The whisper chorus is a different sonic direction for her, whilst the production still feels familiar and cohesive compared to the previous two singles. This is definitely the type of song she shines the most on. 10/10",
    "Tate McRae hasnt missed? The singer-dancer has never felt like a no skips artist to me. She went from feeling like a boring Billie Eilish clone to an sometimes fun Olivia Rodrigo clone to a Walmart-brand Nelly Furtado-alike. The latter direction seemed like something of a breakthrough at first, utilizing both her dance abilities and nasally rasp in a setting that fit them, but *Think Later* ended up only having a few good songs, weighed down by forgettable ballads. Greedy was the undeniable standout, with only a one or two other songs even approaching that level With 3 rock solid singles out, that is not whats happened with her upcoming album Sports car, the third release from *So Close To What*, is the best of the bunch. The past few singles have harkened back to the danceable pop sound that Greedy did so well, but Sports car adds a level of sexiness to the mix, and it pushes the track to a new level. Whispered choruses can be a risk, but this one works perfectly, contributing to the tension the song evokes The biggest thing that sets this apart from the other singles is Tates delivery. Ive not always been the biggest fan of her voice, but she *sells* this song, even more than she did on Greedy to be honest. She delivers the song on the razor-thin edge between teasing and ready to combust from horniness, and she sounds like shes having the time of her goddamn life. Never underestimate the power of a pop singer who sounds like theyre having fun singing the song Over the past 2 years or so, Tate has refined a sound and aesthetic that fit her, and Sports car is probably the best 3 minutes of that sound shes released 8.5/10",
    "I love this. A win for whisper singing. Definitely hear the 00s vibe and I am obsessed with it. 9/10",
    "Tate McRae, attempting to be sexy: \"Oh golly gee!\" This song pretty much just follows the Ava Max formula: Take a song that zillennials like (this time mid 2000s radio pop) and say generically catchy things over its beat. It's fine in concept, if not just boring, but every time I actually hear the lyrics through her mushy enunciation, I'm taken aback by how deeply corny she's acting. [5]",
    "I was not at all expecting this collaboration, but alas, it worked! Bruno Mars gets freaky in that ass-shaking-worthy chorus, and Sexyy Red charms with her characteristically carnal lyrics. I love how this beat perfectly fits Sexyy's flow, which is very unique and needs a specific beat to sound good. But anyway. FAT JUICY AND WET. WET. WET. WET. 7/10",
    "YOU AIN'T NEVER HAD PUNANI LIKE THIS :yelling: Yeah this is fun. Once you get past the CupcaKke-like obscene lyrics (if you need to get past that at all) you're left with a song that has incredibly smooth production courtesy of Bruno and his frequent collaborators The Stereotypes. Bruno and Sexyy also seem to have pretty good chemistry on the track! Sexyy Red has for whatever reason not really clicked with me in the past, but this song is an exception. 8/10",
    "On first listen I was so baffled, but its definitely grown on me. Some of the lyrics are a little questionable coming from Bruno in my personal opinion. To quote a stan twitter reference it appears they were trying to reheat WAP nachos. But they have a great chemistry and the beat is great. 6/10",
    "My current fave on the album!! Obsessed with the chorus, I love how much softer it is compared to the verses, her voice sounds so gently and calming compared to the verses which are more aggressive. 9/10",
    "Probably my favourite moment on this album is the last chorus exploding over twigs yelling (Cranberriesly) with that light breakbeat underneath. Other than that there are some really great melodies throughout and her non-yodelling voice is stunning as usual. Hypnotising and dynamic instrumentals and a unique Twigs twist on the ray of light manual, and just a really great song! 9/10",
    "I do really like this track, but I have to admit that its one of my less preferred ones on what I think is a stellar album. I love how twigs blends danceability with her classically vulnerable lyrics, and Im especially fond of how this track opens up in the latter portion, exploding into frenetic breakbeat that encapsulates both the rave scenes she is paying homage to and the emotional breakdown conveyed in the track. At first, I wasnt crazy about how discordant and sing-songy the vocal melody is (and that is part of my reason for the lack of perfect 10), but after I got to see this live at the ON performance I kind of got what she was trying to do with it, connoting a hypnotic and introspective atmosphere that reflects her inner brooding. Lovely piece & I really like the direction twigs took with this album. 8.6/10",
    "One of the most inspirational songs in recent memory. What I especially love about this song is that it doesn't really try too hard. Many songs feel like they're trying really hard to be this inspirational banger, and what makes this song an inspirational banger is how natural it all seems. Not to mention that this song has been a great help to me when I'm sad. 10/10",
    "Mother is innocent. She only had one match but she made herstory 9/10",
    "This song gets clowned on sometimes but honestly at the right moment this is a perfect song. You have to appreciate the sonic construction - simple, sad piano gives way into cliche-but-effective inspirational drums and little backing vocal adlibs. And obviously rachel slays with the singing and selling the lyrics! Sometimes you really do feel like a little boat on the ocean... 10/10",
    "Sorry but this chorus just triggers my flight response. How many times can we rhyme song with song??? Kind of annoying bc the verses are okay and she has a really nice voice. 4/10",
    "Vapid, cheap, and obnoxious. One of the most derivative songs of the century, with a clear lineage from the feel-good power pop of the late 2000s/early 2010s. However, Fight Song does nothing, aside from pissing me off, better than any of the songs that came before it. Im sure Ms. Platten is a nice lady, but she unfortunately released the corniest song of all time with this one. A genuinely better version of this song is This is Not a Feminist Song from SNL 1/10",
    "The best song of all time. Changed lives and saved them too, an inspirational hymn 10/10",
    "It's beyond over-dramatic, corny, self-aggrandising, embarrassing whatever... sometimes life is embarrassing! and you just have to feel all of that! If you ever see me looping this (and it happens a lot), know I'm going through something extremely character-defining and I will be coming back stronger... I've still got a lotta fight left in me. This song makes me feel something no other song has ever elicited in me, it's really that serious. 10/10",
    "Possibly the most \"millennial liberal\" song of all time, which is why I understand its detractors because that's a double whammy of uncool. That said, I've always found this to be genuinely catchy with a great buildup and vocals, which makes the self-empowerment theme work for me when it rarely does. 10/10",
    "One of his best?? I love how the song stops and starts up again. Incredible lyrics, catchy, and a bit of an interesting shift from the last album! Probably the On The Floor of this album, but I really love the rock angle. 9.5/10",
    "My aoty so far and my fave new artist discovery!! Its not one of my top songs on the album but its still really fun and a lowkey bop. Verses >> chorus here. I really love the delivery of in a city of strangers youre the only one that I want. She is so right tho with party people LIVE and party people FUCK 8.5/10",
    "Not my fav song on the album, but it is a great album and I wish as many people would actually listen to it as well as just saying how great the album cover is lol. Great production all around and a fun party vibe 7/10",
    "I thought the bridge was at the part when she was saying \"oh my guy, you don't wanna waste my time\"",

    "There's a lot on Artpop. Aura was originally Infected Mushroom's demo called Kink. Donatella was a completed demo by Zedd and some khia called Karma Bitch, she took the instrumental as it is and wrote new lyrics and melody for it. Same with Mary Jane Holland, the OG demo is titled Can't Beat The Machines.",
    "[Out Of The Woods]( was also an instrumental Taylor wrote over, along with most of folklore and a few songs on evermore. I actually think she really flourishes in this mode, I wish she'd go back to it.",
    "Someone else already mentioned this but this happens all the time when demos are translated. Kpop songs are often originally in English and then bought and changed to fit the language and rhyme scheme. SM had done this a lot for a long time and I can think of a lot of songs from HYBE artists that have done the same",
    "I know Taylor has talked about some instrumentals (I think ones of Evermore) having already been created by her producer and then she heard them and wrote over them. Im also 99% sure theres a Blackpink-only demo of Sour Candy, which Im assuming means Gaga worked on that song after a full version already existed. In general my guess is that even artists known for having a heavy hand in their music use more stuff than we might think that was made previously by their producers or from demos that were floated their way.",
    "A few songs from Folklore and Evermore by Taylor Swift had been used in parts of National songs. Dorothea was their version of Give it to Teddy in Bobs Burgers.",
    "Lady Gaga has definitely rewritten demos. A lot of artists who got started writing, or did a lot of demo work early on went on to release either their own version, or songs that just never got picked up. Sia does this, too.",
    "Dua Lipa has an unreleased version (demo) of the song Borderline which she helped write. Tove Lo ended up using it and changed some lyrics and the view point of the song. Both are on YouTube so its fun to listen to both!",
    "Rewriting a demo is different from writing a top line to an instrumental. A lot of artists will get a demo then swap a few words or a verse without fundamentally changing the melody or lyrics. Taylor has talked a lot about her process, you can find tons of her demos and interviews. I haven't seen as much for the others. How she's described it is sometimes a parallel process. She's always writing melodies and lyrics, they're always making beats and instrumentals. Sometimes she sends/brings it to them and asks for a particular instrumental vibe, sometimes they send/brings something they're working on it and she writes to it. We know there's a few times where Jack or Aaron had an instrumental they'd pitched to someone else who passed, then she picked it up. Like Lavender Haze was initially pitched to Zoe Kravitz. But that doesn't she ever had the other artist's demo and was working off it.",

    "I dont know if it counts but the only one I can think of is Kesha/Girls Generation - Run Devil Run. Any other examples? (Actually I recall a songs melody by Duffy being used for a kpop song too)",
    "The Sour Candy demo was recorded by Madison Love who originally wrote the song for Blackpink. Somehow the song got onto Gagas desk first, and she invited Blackpink on as a feature when she learned who it was originally meant for. Kind of a cool story of how pop songs get passed around multiple hands before being claimed and released.",
    "All the songs cowritten by Aaron Dessner on Folklore were his instrumentals that she wrote lyrics to. Willow was written in the same way but I'm not sure about the rest of Evermore because at that point lockdown was lifted and they could be in the same room together.",

    "Wait what?! lol",

    "This doesn't fit OP's question perfectly though, I think they were talking about rewriting only the lyrics specifically. \"dorothea\" and \"Give It to Teddy\" share instrumentals (since Aaron composed the harmonies on most folkmore songs), but they don't have the same melody, as Taylor rewrote the melody as well.",

    "Omg listening to this makes me feel like Im in a parallel universe ",
    "So she didn't create those songs from scratch?",
    "the song description of moves like jagger says it is about dancing [ Maroon 5 removed the lyrics about cunnilingus from the song moves like jagger [",
    "I don't think that's what they're talking about. Those were her original songs that she later changed; they're talking about getting a demo someone else wrote and rewriting it for yourself.",
    "Sour Candy's production was heavily modified from the original. The demo is out there. It even has the same English lyrics as the visualizer for BP's parts.",
    "this isnt true. On her most recent album she had 5 completely self written songs",
    "OP doesnt necessarily mean remakes of other released songs, but songs where the lyrics changed from the demos to the final, I think. If you watch SM behind the scenes videos with members reacting to demos you can often hear the original English lyrics (Walk and Baggy Jeans are two recent examples)! A lot of the composers, songwriters and producers they use in their songwriting camps are foreign so it makes sense they would write English/placeholder lyrics to be replaced with Korean by SMs lyricists.",
    "An FX song was originally Boyfriend Material for Ariana Grande",
    "That was also Girls Generation- they released their version of Mercy as Dancing Queen.",
    "Reminds me of Gaga trying to give Britney \"Telephone\", but she already had a song on Circus called \"Phonography\" and she didn't want two phone-related songs on the album. So Gaga kept Telephone.",
    "She wrote the topline, which is both melody and lyrics.",
    "According to Aaron Dessner, he sent over the instrumental to Willow and she sent back the lyrics 10 minutes later.",
    "Not all of them, exile and betty weren't Aaron demos",
    "She wrote lyrics and top melody*",
    "Guess the magic drug that has me hooked on evermore is Aaron Dessner. Its such a distinct album from all of her works, and for me the instrumentals were my favourite part along with some of the lyricism.",
    "Which National songs? I googled but didnt find anything",
    "They werent created specifically for The Fame, no.",
    "The fame album no",
    "LMFAO. Omg....Love how they try to make you think its about dancing and Jagger's iconic moves on stage. Its not, really. Jagger was a very well known for sleeping around (rumors with both men and women). Actually read the lyrics and you'll see its not exactly about dancing. They probably implied it was to \"keep it clean.\" so the radio would play it. Do you seriously think that a person who wrote the song \"Sugar\" would write such an innocent song about dancing? LOL - a couple lines from the song... **You want to know how to make me smile** **Take control, own me just for the night** **Take me by the tongue** **And I'll know you** **Kiss til you're drunk** **And I'll show you** Um, yeah....its about *dancing.*",
    "Ive heard it, the main differences are the completely revamped instrumental and Gagas verse, everything BP sings plus the chorus is mostly the same.",
    "True. She has the sole writing credits for My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys, Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?, The Black Dog, Peter, and The Manuscript.",
    "All of her co-writes are also not necessarily to track",
    "And the world is greater for the Gaga Telephone.",
    "they never got released, aaron played the original versions on instagram live before he gave taylor the instrumentals",
    "those are actually some of the good songs on the album (except WAOLOM)",
    "Why do I love WAOLOM",
    "It's her Disney villain song."
